This change particularly affects students who are enrolled in private universities, and in universities with low graduation rates and poor repayment records. This paper specifically analyses the first change whereby student attending private universities will now be granted smaller scholarships than they were given before. The analysis is carried out in the perspective of Labaree’s goals for education and the losses or profits which will be accrued as a result of means-targeted scholarship that the Cal Grant program has adopted.

 ANALYSIS Labaree (1997) argues that higher education has three goals namely “democratic equality, social efficiency, and social mobility” (p. 41). The Cal Grant program’s funding policy change will affect these goals in interesting ways. Democratic Equality Education makes it possible to have an informed citizenry who can then make informed decisions on matters affecting the nation – this is the core of democracy. Informed citizenry is very significant because a society is often run on a collective judgment basis thus ensuring that a significant portion of the citizens is competent is the way to democracy (Labaree, 1997, p. 42). In order for this to be realized, there has to be “citizenship training, equal treatment, and equal access as pertain to education” (Labaree, 1997, p. 44). Using this insight, the Cal Grant program’s change in policy to a means-target scholarship in favor of public university students will obviously have a negative effect on the efforts of building an informed citizenry.

 This is because a portion of the citizens who will wish to attend private universities might not be able to do so and if they are ineligible for public universities their dream for higher education might have to wait longer. In this manner, according to the democratic equality goal, the societal competence is lowered and depending on the statistics involved, this will affect the kind of decisions that a society will make. The policy change by the Cal Grant program will therefore lead to reduced levels of citizenship training, propagates unequal treatment, and unequal access to education.

 On the other hand, sponsoring undocumented students can arguably be said to be a move towards achieving the democratic equality goal because there are higher chances that these students will eventually be incorporated into the US citizenship. Social Efficiency Schooling should enable students to be useful economically to the society by ensuring that they “fill structurally necessary market roles” (Labaree, 1997, p. 42). Labaree (1997) suggests that voluntary sponsoring should not be allowed to solely fund this goal.

 This is because some individuals may take advantage of this and engage in a form of education that will maximally benefit them. This will not create socially efficiency as the market will experience some kind of imbalance in availability of skills whereby some skills will be in excess while others will be in shortage. This seems to be a call for partial sponsorship. In the context of the Cal Grant program, the new means-target sponsoring may be said to be in line with Laboree’s (1997) view.

 This is because, if students enrolling in private universities are heavily sponsored, they will only tend to engage in forms of education that would bring them maximum benefits. This will not be ‘filling structurally necessary market roles’ as Labaree (1997) puts it. Reducing the funding to private universities will therefore channel students to other areas or just limit them to lower levels of education thus enabling them to effectively fill the market gaps that need their levels of education hence creating social efficiency.

 On the other hand, funding of undocumented students does help in creating social efficiency. This is because the undocumented students form or will later form part of society’s workforce, and therefore funding them to gain skills will help them to make a positive economic contribution to the society by fitting into some market roles in the society. Social Mobility Education is viewed as a private good in the eyes of the students. To the students, education is a means of being competitive in the market and therefore a way of achieving desirable social positions in the society (Labaree, 1997).

 Private universities give a chance to students to achieve this competitive advantage. Some courses in public universities are overly competitive and private universities come in to fill this gap. It is therefore clear that reducing the level of funding to private university students will in essence be undermining social mobility goal of education. In this essence, freedom of choice for students will be lost and the social mobility goal of education will be defeated. Funding undocumented students will definitely help them in gaining social mobility.

 CONCLUSION As the author has pointed out severally in the article, the three goals of education are contradictory. While each has a set of positive effects, the benefit accrued from each of the goal is purely dependent on the line of perspective. The Cal Grant program’s change in policy is therefore beneficial and harmful depending on which goal of education is examined. Reference Labaree, D.F. (1997).

https://studentshare.org/health-sciences-medicine/1475516-child-obesity,Child Obesity,"Child Obesity. Articles Overview Introduction Child obesity has grown into a very seriousproblem. The statistics showed that thirty years ago two times fewer children had this problem in comparison with today’s data. This fact considerably increased the interest of scholars to the given problem. Obesity among children negatively influences their physical and mental health. In order to find the methods to fight obesity, it is important to determine the main factors that influence its level. The given paper presents the overview of three articles, in which the authors considered different sides of the problem with one main purpose that is to find the ways to decrease the level of obesity among children.

 The article “Parental Communication Style's Impact on Children's Attitudes Toward Obesity and Food Advertising” by Hyunjae (Jay) Yu emphasizes the important role of parenting in the struggle against obesity. The author reminds about obesity level increasing and the effect advertising may have on the level of obesity. Fast-food is actively advertized and children are usually the first who follow this advertising. Here the author points out that the children of 7-12 years old spend much time with their parents, thus parents may have serious impact on children’s attitude towards advertising and, according to Hyunjae (Jay) Yu, this impact should be carefully studied.

 The main purpose of the research conducted by the author was to study the effect of communication between children and their parents and the effect of advertising on the level of child obesity. The outcomes showed that the communication between parents and children has considerable impact on how children perceive fast-food advertising and their behavior toward it (Hyunjae (Jay) Yu, 2011). The article “Differences between European Americans and African Americans in the Association between Child Obesity and Disrupted Parenting” by Simons et al also emphasizes the importance of parent’s role.

 However, the article deals with the issue of how the parents’ impact varies relating the race. The authors investigated the families of European and African Americans. The study showed that the children from African American families suffer from obesity more frequently than children from European American families. The connection between the healthy communication with parents, their care about child’s weight and obesity is inversely proportional for European American families. However, having studied African American families, the authors came to the conclusion that in these families the communication and care about child’s weight did not play a very important role, thus the connection between parents’ care and children’s obesity was not found.

 According to Simons et al, it may happen primarily because in African American families high weight is not considered to be a serious problem and African Americans pay less attention to it than European Americans. Simultaneously, the authors point out that that the situation has been changing as it can be stated that more and more African Americans start to pay attention to the problem of obesity (Simons et al, 2008). The third article titled “Child obesity ‘levelling off’” provides us with more positive information concerning the problem of obesity.

 It states that recent investigations showed that the forecasts on the level of obesity made for the year 2020 were too pessimistic as for now the number of overweight children is not so high as it was forecasted. Thus, we can hope that the level may drop by 2020. According to Gillian Merron, a health minister, “Obesity is one of the biggest health challenges we face. There are currently 1.5 million children and 25 million adults who are overweight or obese, leaving them at increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart and liver disease” (“Child obesity ‘levelling off’).

 Thus, the information provided by the article gives some hope to us. We can see that it is possible to decrease the level of obesity by common interference of parents, teachers and the government. However, it is pointed out in the article that more efforts are needed from the side of the government to improve the quality of food and from the parents’ and teachers’ side to pay enough attention to the problem of obesity and help children overcome it. Conclusion We can see that three articles under consideration address the same problem differently, but come to the same conclusion: the proper interference of parents, teachers and the government can and should decrease the level of child obesity.

 The task of the government is to improve the food quality by providing restrictions on harmful food production and its advertising. The role of parents is crucial as they can influence the children and their attitude towards fast food as well as their weight. Common efforts should bring and will bring positive results, let’s hope that they will be taken.

https://studentshare.org/business/1475576-business-writing,Business writing,"24 April, In order to communicate effectively in an organization, business writing skills are essential especially to people responsible for disseminating information to different people in the company. As such, this paper seeks to critically evaluate the three step writing process that can be used for business communication. The paper will also outline the advantages and disadvantages of oral and written media. When writing for business, planning is the first step and this is the most important element of this process.

 The writer ought to carefully analyse the situation and try to come up with relevant information that can be disseminated to the people. The aspect of relevance of information is very important since it helps the writer to remain focused. Essentially, the main aim of business writing is to convey a message to the targeted audience and the writer should be in control of this information since he or she is aware of what they want to achieve from such communication. It is also important for the writer to organize the information so that it can be tailored into a meaningful message.

 In terms of oral media, the writer ought to choose the appropriate communication channel that can reach the targeted people. Basically, planning helps the writer to remain focused so that he or can she achieve the desired goal by avoiding irrelevant information that can confuse the targeted readers. The second step in business writing is related to designing the message. The writer must adapt to the audience and compose a message that is likely to achieve the desired goals. In designing the message, the writer should select only relevant and important information that can appeal to the interests of the targeted audience.

 The aspect of clarity is very important when writing for business. It is important for the writer to use clear and concise terms so that the readers of the document will easily understand its contents. The message should be designed in such a way that it would achieve the desired goals among the targeted readers. The writer should also be in a position to control the message so that it can fulfil his or her interests. Writing for business is specifically meant for a particular purpose and this is the reason why the subject ought to be clear and precise.

 The other important consideration when writing for business is that it should be short and to the point. The third step when writing for business is related to proofreading as well as distribution. It is important to proofread the document so as to ensure that there are no errors which may compromise the quality of the writing. Revising the document also helps the writer to eliminate information that may be irrelevant. When the document has been edited for all mistakes, it is then distributed to the targeted audiences.

 There are different methods that can be used to distribute the document. For instance, it can be displayed on all notice boards if it is meant for everyone in the organization. It can also be distributed to specific departments concerned. In some cases, memos can be distributed to the individuals addressed. There are many advantages of oral media in business communication. People will be in a face to face communication situation and they are likely to mutually understand each other if they create a free and open environment.

 When people are communicating face to face, they can also use informal language that can help them to understand each other more. However, the major disadvantage of oral communication is that some people with seniority in the organization may tend to insubordinate junior employees in the organization. When this scenario happens, it can be noted that junior employees may feel uncomfortable to express themselves. This can hamper communication. On the other hand, it can also be seen that there are different advantages and disadvantages of using written media.

 The main advantage of written media is that it is authentic since it is official communication. This is the easiest way of disseminating vital information in the organization to the targeted people. It is easier to distribute written memos to the targeted people than to communicate with them verbally. This may be a tedious task to engage each employee in dialogue. The other advantage of written media is that it is clear and to the point. It is very easy to understand since it specifically deals with a particular subject.

 However, the only disadvantage of written media is that it is often short and this may result in omission of other important information. The readers may fail to grasp the contents of the document if it is very short and brief.",Business,Essay,Undergraduate
https://studentshare.org/philosophy/1475688-euthyphro-yt-plato,Euthyphro : Plato,"Euthyphro – Plato On the one hand, Euthyphro assumes the role of a plaintiff who is bound to prosecute his father at the time due to a murderous act committed against another criminal who Euthyphro believes should have undergone fair administration of justice prior to death. The responsibility of employing a pious or religiously legal deed fell on him after the Athenian spiritual interpreters failed to confer with his father in time to settle legal matters concerning the person at fault. Socrates, on the other hand, acknowledges in truth that a man who is capable of prosecution ought to specialize in affirming what “piety” is.

 Out of this situation, hence, emerges the issue of defining ‘piety’ or ‘holiness’ in which Socrates takes advantage of his humble condition, being accused of ‘impiety’, to find resolution to the question of piety through his philosophical dialogue with Euthyphro. By his initial attempt to address the inquiry of Socrates, Euthyphro claims “Piety is doing what I’m doing now” in reference to his provision of charges against his father which is based upon the traditional justice known in Greek mythology, as when gods do not let their fathers go unpunished despite strength of kinship.

 Thus, since Uranus received punishment from Cronos in the same manner that Cronos availed of no impunity from Zeus, Euthyphro’s father is subject to reap the harsh consequences of his action through the son who judges it as immoral by nature. Socrates, nevertheless, refutes this stating “That may be an example of piety, perhaps, but it’s not a definition” as though to imply that one such illustration may not serve alone to constitute the meaning of piety. Moreover, Euthyphro proceeds to argue “Piety or holiness, Socrates, appears to me to be that part of justice which attends to the gods, as there is the other part of justice which attends to men.

” To Socrates, this argument sounds almost satisfactory yet he requires that Euthyphro be more specific about his view of ‘attention’ on the ground that its application to the gods and its application to men or other things may not be understood in the same light. He further exemplifies with the art of attending to horses in this regard and points out that “horses are said to require attention, and not every person is able to attend to them, but only a person skilled in horsemanship” to which Euthyphro readily agrees (Gutchess, 2003).

 Similarly, it fits a huntsman to attend to dogs as it fits ox-herd to attend to oxen so that Socrates manages to infer herein that the other man could be supposing piety or holiness to be the art of attending to the gods by definition whenever one conducts himself to be holy or good. At this stage, Euthyphro expresses disagreement and corrects the use of the term by substituting ‘ministration’ for ‘attention’. Considering another aspect of defining holiness, Euthyphro proposes “Holiness is what is agreeable to the gods” yet only to be opposed by Socrates as the latter counters “But, as the stories say, the gods don’t always agree among themselves” after which the former revises the statement with “Holiness is serving the gods … specifically, serving them with prayer and sacrifices.

” Apparently, to this extent, Socrates observes that Euthyphro returns to his inadequate position on piety where it is not sufficient to define holiness by merely doing what gods approve of as in pleasing or offering sacrifices to them though such may be taken to be valid description. As a consequence of several instances that Euthyphro finds himself caught in circles of a personal argument that could not seem to converge toward a definitive point of establishing the meaning of holiness even while Socrates seeks to guide the endeavor, he walks out of the conversation with a sense of impatience and frustration.

 We all know that Socrates is widely recognized for the philosophy of teaching by way of rationalizing within a systematic doubt process in order to bring out the utter essence of truth in the subject of query. When he was able to determine the man’s wisdom in him along with its expanse, it was when he equivalently realized that he is wise only because he is first ignorant to that degree. No wonder why in his dialogue with Euthyphro, his goal had been to evaluate how accurate and sincere to truth would an argument on identifying piety be if it were to possess solid definition that transcends time and unifies differing perspectives into a natural agreement derived from having justified that the term and its substance under various circumstances.

 This is primarily the reason that Socrates had kept on the intellectual effort of asking and doubting the propositions of Euthyphro on the basis of which, I think ‘piety’, as in the plain denotation we commonly know of, still pertains to the ‘quality or state of being religious and dutiful’. However, since there are a couple of ways by which to exhibit piousness of character, then, being religious or acting to respond to the call of duty entails not just the sole deed of righteousness in its strict sense or form.

 The virtues of compassion and of forgiveness may have gone beyond the culture and severe attitude of Greek religion in dealing with the sinners, but in my examination on account of Socratic principle, these are essentially valuable traits of holiness as well as they reflect the duty of discerning the good in men and the hope that man’s weakness can be guided on the path of piety to yield reparation.

https://studentshare.org/english/1478295-obama-dawdwhos-fooling-who,"Obama, Dawd:whos fooling who","Ali Bujassoum Kelly Gehlhoff ENG 101 28th April, Obama, Dawd:who’s fooling who? This article d, “No Bully at the Pulpit”, by Maureen Dowd,a distinguished commentator and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary. She argues that President Obama may have learnt how to feel the pain of Americans and grieve with them, but he has not learnt how to govern. She questions the fact that President Obama was able to convince the American public to share his opinion on gun control, but was not able to get 60 senators to support him pass the bill in Capitol Hill.

 Dowd claims that the senators are not intimidated or afraid of him in the least; even republic statesmen who would never have voted for the bill were amazed that the president could only get 54 percent in a house that his party controls. The influence in the articles are evident in the fact that it is easy for the ordinary American readers who make the bulk of readers for the daily to buy into her reasoning, considering her reputation and the fact that her claims are seemingly supported by the retrospective actions of the senators and president.

 President Obama thinks, according to the writer, he can make use of emotion to influence the senators like he does to the public (Dowd). However, she posits that the senators are “grown men with power” and they cannot be moved by emotive speeches. The president looked set to make some regulations after the massacre in Newton and he said to a loud applause that the Newtown families deserved a vote. It looked like he was going to get exactly what he wanted but he somehow lost his momentum and even told journalist he suspected his bill would not be passed by the congress (Dowd).

 Thesis: Was Dowd objective in presenting her article as she did? Was her reasoning true about the president? How did the column succeed in convincing the audience as she claims? Was the president weak in handling the senators or were the senators impossible to handle? If Obama had wanted to have his way, the writer suggests he should have gone off the highroad and talked to specific senators directly and made them see it his wayinstead of using his vice president. For instance, he could have brought Mark Begich the Alaskan senator and asked him how the bill could be adjusted to make him vote and defend it.

 Better still, he could have consulted the view of someone like Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota and sweet-talk her into voting for the bill based on the fact that she was a mother and she had a term long enough to make such tough calls. Dowd further suggests that he could have strong armed some of the republican senators in whose states he won with the public or used his friendship with the likes of Tom Coburn to get an extra vote in. For instance, why did he give the moving speech about the shameful acts before the vote and not after, when that could have helped him go a long way in votes?

 Dowd believes that there were many ways Obama could have used to get 60 votes; he simply did not try hard enough. She argues that the president simply does not like to sell his ideas; he assumes that he is on to the right thing and everybody else can see it his way. The article closes by saying it is not just about doing the right thing for the senators, since they have to sell their ideas to their electorate back home; and if they cannot convince them they may not get re-elected. In logical reasoning, Dowd was true in ascribing the fears of the senators to the electorate opinions.

 Moreover, she uses emotive language in ascertaining that the president had no room for other people’s opinions. She finds him to be just some sort of demagogue who can influence the public’s feelings by manipulating them, but loses out when it comes to convincing those who matter. However, in the first paragraph she begins by saying something positive about him; she talks of the greying man weeping with American families and acknowledges that he has learnt experience how to share the grief of Americans.

 This statement is placed strategically to enhance the appeal to emotions in her appeal. She uses the sympathy Americans have for the grieving families to create a comparison that paints the president and a man who can appreciate sadness, but is incapable of doing nothing about fixing its cause, thus the sympathy they felt for him is used to make them question his leadership qualities. Before she claims he hasn’t learnt how to lead, she establishes a common ground especially with those who may not agree with the subset opinions.

 This is done so that when she lashes out, the readers will be in a frame of mind to think her reasonable. Through this, they are likely to agree with her negative sentiments as they did with the positive ones she has cast herself as an open minded and realistic person. She uses logical appeal in the percentages of 90% Americans not translating into 60 votes in the house. How is it that he can talk to the public and convince them yet be so unsuccessful with the senate? Having covertly posed the questions on the audience, she goes ahead to overtly answer them, she say Obama is a weak leader and no-one in the senate is afraid of him.

 However, this is a fallacious argument since the audience would assume that the public is afraid of Obama and that’s why they supported him. Furthermore, contrasting the senate with the public by claiming they are grown adults also implies that the public is immature. However, she cleverly makes it sound as though Obama is only good at talking to people, but not getting the job done. To illustrate to the audience how easy it was, the task Obama failed to accomplish, she gives a few hypothetical examples of how he could have convinced democrat senators or even republican senators to see things his way.

 By making it look simple, she manages to depict Obama as being more incompetent. She makes it appear as if the whole responsibility of seeing and implementing the right things is the president’s and the senate is just there to be convinced. She seems to agree with Obama, since she says he assumes that everyone will see things the right way like him. However, this brings out Dowd’s own illogical reasoning, clearly, if she can see that he is right, it means that even the senators who have been elected by the people to safeguard their interests should also see it; thus, leaving the responsibility of convincing them to Obama and blaming him of bad leadership when he fails to make them think like the grown adults she described earlier is in more ways than the one; hypocritical.

 Ultimately, through rhetoric, Dowd puts across a fairly strong attempt of convincing the audience that despite the fact that the president was right and the senator failed to agree with him (possibly because they were worried about their re-elections), it was the president who deserved the blame for failing to pass the bill. When one thinks about it objectively and logically, it is not really a realistic point of reasoning; however, it is likely that even audience who would support Obama may be convinced to put the blame on him if they do not carefully read between the lines.

 As such, the article can be acknowledged for being convincing, but it does not portray the true situation on the ground. Could Dowd be objective, she would not only have focused on the president’s failure as a result of his character, but more deeply examined the reasons the senators did not approve the bill. Therein she would have likely unearthed conspicuously, among other things, a fear to offend the electorate and jeopardize future re-election. If she had brought forward that side of the argument, the audience would have been more sympathetic to the president’s failure.

 However, since that was clearly not her intention, she opted to expose plainly the weak point of the president for her own malicious gain.

https://studentshare.org/marketing/1478296-hasbro-merchandise-and-services-compared-to-its-competitors,Hasbro merchandise and services compared to its competitors,"Task: Hasbro merchandise and services compared to its competitors. Products/ Service Hasbro Company is located in Pawtucket within the area of Rhode Island. It is one of the principal toy makers in the world, and produces board games. Helal Hassenfeld and Henry formed the company in 1923 (Fleisher 110). It was initially called Hassenfeld Brothers Inc. Hasbro hit the market in 1992 when they introduced a toy called Mr. Potato Head and later in 1964 when they brought G.I Joe action. In 1968, the entity altered its name to Hasbro Industries.

 The company then purchased Milton Bradley Company adding to itself Candy Land, Yahtzee, Twister and Game of Life (Fleisher, 120). This made the company increase its game line above its competitors. On film production, Battleship was not a hit in the market because critics referred to it as cash grab. News of upcoming films such as Hungry, Hungry Hippos and Monopoly were met with similar response. Hasbro brought on board Transformers toys in early 1984. This led to an unbeaten cartoon series and current live action films.

 Additional toys under Hasbro Company include Pokemon, Play-Doh and NERF. Other popular board games include Dungeons & Dragons, Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary, Scrabble and Cranium (Chan &Wishner 20). Hasbro competitors such as Mattel seem to assume an appropriate position compared to Hasbro. This is because of the popularity of its dolls and simplicity of its business. This makes it easier to understand Hasbro’s that is a murky mix of manufactured goods. Instead of Hasbro abridge its business like Mattel, It complicated it further.

 It has worked together with World Trade Jewelers to make jewelry based on its Scrabble, Candy Land and My Little Pony. Hasbro Company also signed a partnership with Netflix. The deal allows Netflix to stream its clients with shows such as my little pony and Transformers. Lastly, Hasbro collaborated with Zynga to manufacture toys based on its Facebook games. This response focused on Mattel’s games such as Angry Birds that were made by Rovio Entertainment. Mattel acquired HIT Entertainment that makes Bob the Builder and Thomas the Tank Engine.

 This enabled the company to increase its stock exchange on the market and outdo Hasbro. In addition to this, Mattel also produces dolls such as Disney princes. They also produce toys such as Hot Wheels, Fisher Price and Barbie (Fleisher 137). Investing in the movie industry is challenging idea for these companies. This forced Walt Disney to scale down its movie operations. It shifted its movie operation to Marvel and Lucasfilm. This was to minimize risk after a big loss in the production of Mars needs moms and John Carter (Chan &Wishner 22).

 Given that Hasbro’s biggest sales were the girl’s toy, it is certain that it would boost its production of dolls and toys for girls. However, it would be hard for Hasbro to come up with a hit like Mattel’s Monster High dolls and Barbie. Based on this ideology, it is likely that Mattel will outshine Hasbro based on simple business model, stronger margins and admired female-centered goods Organized Structure Hasbro compared to its rivals Hasbro just like its competitors is a public company traded at the New York stock Exchange.

 Hassenfeld is the chairperson of the Board managing Hasbro Inc. He owns 4% of the company’s share. The main stockholders are corporations such as the Barkley’s Global Investors UK Holding LTD and The State Street Corporation. There are other private stockholders (Fleisher160). Financial background of Hasbro compared to its competitors Hasbro Inc. increased its net revenue from $ 2,816,230 to $ 3,151,481 from 2002 to 2006. In addition, Shareholders Equity increased by $3 while the debt ratio declined by 23%.

 This is an indication of a stable and financially sound company (Fleisher 150). The company intends to maintain its financial position by developing its brands, producing new brands that are attractive to the market and offering a wide range of entertainment services. This allows consumers to have a wide range of merchandise and services to choose from thus increasing the company’s sales. The company’s market includes The USA and other international markets. It has opened offices in major cities of the world thus creating more outlets for its merchandise (Chan &Wishner 11).

 Increase in revenue in boys products were offset by declines in the games categories. The boy’s revenue increased by over 4% based on higher sales of Star Wars and Marvels products. Preschool products increased by 25 due to the sale of playskool rescue Heros and Sesame Street. The games products declined by 9% while the girl’s products declined by 18%. This was due to poor sales in littlest pet shop and furreal friends (Chan &Wishner 3). Operating profit for the year 2012 was $15,726. This decrease compared to 2011 had a profit of $48,923.

 The change in profits was attributable to poor sales in 2012, high competition from Mattel and increases in expenses. Works Cited Chan, David. & Wishner, Andrew. Hasbro, Inc. Chaner Capital.

https://studentshare.org/creative-writing/1478537-short-story-assignment,Of Being Martin Black," Looking out on the morning rain had a deeper sentiment to Martin Black as it was commonplace to witness syringes, yesterday’s snack cake from the rundown community convenience store, and a mish-mash of broken child toys streaming down the thoroughfare in a mad torrent of rainwater beside this Los Angeles tenement. Yes, Martin Black understood mourning rain, with the delight of an angry black widow and the stamina of a legless cheerleader. “Martin Black!” The shout echoed through the decrepit corridor leading into the ramshackle family room where his mother spent so many of her waking hours.

 His mother was a real hospitality chef, just a drizzle of her favorite afternoon soaps and a pinch of cheap cologne that stunk up the staunchly decaying household interior like a sweetened dose of rotten flesh. “Martin Black! Mama needs a foot rub. These damn corns are killin’ my tired feet. Get your rump out here and help Mama right now!” The sound of her liquor-induced garble was barely coherent while the echo of her ignorance pounded against the paint-deprived walls. Mama, as she demanded he call her since as long as he could remember, had dropped out of middle school at age 13 in order to pursue a romance with an older high school sophomore.

 After Jimbo (that’s what the neighborhood gangs had labeled her first husband) received a single gunshot wound to the chest, Mama not only lost the love of her life but was forced to take employment at the local hair salon since the local school board considered her a high-risk distraction to the educational process. Of course, Mama lasted only two months before striking a red-headed regular boasting a stylish bouffant (and a disrespectful mouth, Mama had said) with a bottle of AquaNet, plucking out her left eyeball.

 What’s in a name? Martin suddenly asked himself as he grabbed the dull scissors and a bottle of peroxide from the dispirited bathroom shelf and hurried down the hallway to play master surgeon to a foul-smelling bump of foot fungus. Welfare, it seemed, was timid about providing sustenance for toe jam. “Coming, Mama.” The sound of it was self-demeaning. As Martin glided slowly underneath her lifted foot, ready to tackle the hideous project of removal, Mama rambled on about her son’s lethargy and lack of value to the household, demanding he pursues a job at the local convenience store.

 “It’s high time, Martin Black, that you start earnin’ some ya keep around here!” “Mama, you know the neighborhood links my name to Daddy’s. Nobody wants me to work in their businesses. I’ve been thinkin’, Mama, about takin’ the Greyhound to Colorado and getting me a job on the pipeline.” Martin suddenly felt the piercing ache of a blunt wound to the palm of his hand as Mama violently swung her feet out of the creaking and hideous flowered recliner.

 Her abrupt and unusually adept motion caught him completely by surprise as he tumbled backward viciously, tipping over her life’s blood in the process: the 18-inch black-and-white console set that regurgitated her worthless dramas all the day long. “You’re gonna gimme 40 bucks for that boob tube, you ungrateful, selfish little heathen!” Mama concerned herself not with Martin’s gaping flesh wound, instead of lurching to the fallen console to rectify her welfare-induced playwrights that brought her such sustenance for her lifestyle of sloth.",Creative Writing,Essay,College
https://studentshare.org/music/1478558-concert-report,Concert Report,"An Analytical Review of Andras Schiff’s Concert Performing “Piano Concerto No. I in D Minor” by Bach and “ Concerto No. 20 in D Minor” by Mozart The music-filled evening in the Digital Concert Hall comprised Andras Schiff who played and conducted for an ensemble that was bound to bring to life two of the acclaimed masterpieces in the history of music. In this regard, Schiff and company rendered an enthralling Baroque piece through Bach’s Piano Concerto No. I in D Minor and an equally stimulating classical work via Mozart’s Concerto No.

 20 in D Minor. While the majority of the audience in the event consisted of artists and musicians themselves, there were also students and members of the faculty of our college whose attendance to the concert may be felt with growing degree of interest and curiosity. According to historical findings, when Bach composed Concerto I in D minor during the 17th-18th-century Baroque period, which is chiefly characterized by heavy ornamentation of music, such composition was originally delivered as a harpsichord concerto.

 It was claimed to have been treated on the basis of an endeavor with a strayed violin though afterwards, however, Concert I in D minor was eventually modified into an arrangement with organ to suit two other cantatas of Bach in 1728. On the other hand, more than half a decade later, the Piano Concerto 20 was composed by Mozart in 1785, a classic age in which his solo performance of the piece earned wide recognition and was reaching and inspiring even Beethoven. Some contemporaries and even 19th-century musicians who came after Beethoven’s time paid tribute and kept in their repertoire Mozart’s Piano Concerto 20 in D minor which was further popularized through the cadenzas written by fine composers such as C.V. Alkan, J.

 Brahms, J.N. Hummel, C. Schumann, and F. Busoni. As Schiff attempted to exhibit justice for the creation of Bach, he made it certain that the orchestra could spontaneously manage to score movements in allegro – adagio – allegro pattern. Technically, this was generally evident in the manner by which their instrumentation conveyed consonance especially despite the distinct texture of Schiff’s craft over piano which amply resembled Bach’s original harpsichord solo. It seemed that being a pianist and a conductor at the same time designated the dual nature of his task in unity as the initial piano work led his conductorship to encourage gradual entry of the strings and generate the intended harmony from among the violins whose players were themselves apparently carried away by the intervals of their yield to allegro.

 Out of the Piano Concerto No. I in D Minor, the presence of liveliness and the spirit of cheerful brisk along the fast tempo could be thought of collectively as the main striking feature of the musical piece. Similarly, the orchestration of Concerto No. 20 in D Minor was established in an approach that brought across movements of the order allegro – romanze – allegro assai for which Schiff began with his piano in a rather solemn tune prior to the progressive fusion of violin raptures.

 Mozart’s Concert 20 varies more in movement compared to that of Bach, but it nearly possessed the same elements of sound as the other. Judging from every aspect of the live performance, the high quality of the melodic content of either composition, as conducted and played by Schiff and company, indicated how technically demanding the concert had been overall. Each instrumentalist may be observed to have acquired mastery of the individual part, being precisely and systematically collaborative to the rest of ensemble in following a sequence of acts.

 The notable synergy within the team of players herein reflected passion and extreme levels of inclination on both scores so that this altogether meant the role assumed by Schiff to be effective and capable of driving members to the extent of exceeding standards and making the exceptional sounds almost seem like a wonder of fiction. To me, the unexpected appeal of the concert had been something truly heavenly and magical. I suppose that Bach and Mozart must be two of those who form the pillars of music with their essence extending from the baroque and classic genres to the modern era due to the thematic versatility and exquisite art found in the creative allegros of Bach’s Piano Concerto No.

 I in D Minor and Mozart’s Concerto No. 20 in D Minor. It felt that Schiff and orchestra was able to justify the capacity of these pieces to liven up basic human reflexes as they induce a sense of liberation, comic relief, or anything between blissfully intense and outrageously high. Musicians occupied performance spaces that allowed for the proper execution of instruments and perhaps zones that satisfied their necessity to hear their personal devices well without inevitable distraction from an adjacent wave of rhythms.

 I could not quite figure any glitches, not even a slight concrete reason to disfavour the presentation, seeing how others in the audience marvelled at the genius show. Moreover, the cellos sounded grand indeed whereas the wind section made the flutes exude in detail the heart and rich story of each great work in the repertoire at the time. All in all, there occurred depths of virtuous operation in the side of the performers whose subjects at hand were accomplished with excellence. Somewhere, we had become naturally and effortlessly engaged with the ancient melodies of perfectly climatic violins.

 Everyone appeared delighted in the process, not initially expecting to have tuned in such wonderfully tragic rhythmic fluidity along the transformation of tamed notes to voracious ones, worthy of encore. ",Music,Essay,Undergraduate
https://studentshare.org/management/1478579-leadership-traits-and-skills-leadership,"Leadership, traits and skills Leadership","Traits Approach The trait approach, according to Northouse p.19), indicates that a person must possess certain qualities in order to be a leader. These traits include intelligence, self-confidence, determination, integrity, and sociability. All of these traits are positively and directly related to leadership. The higher the intelligence, the stronger is the leadership. The more the leader is assured of his competencies, the brighter his vision is. He has successful leadership if he is determined toward the acquisition of organizational goals and objectives.

 Other important traits of a leader include extraversion, conscientiousness, openness, and low neuroticism. In my organization, our managers show sufficient integrity in their behavior. For example, they conduct regular performance appraisals by reviewing employees’ performance regularly, and giving them sincere feedback. They have enough self-esteem in that they believe in their ideas and capabilities. For example, they are able to stick to their decisions, without letting others overpower them.

 They are extremely intelligent in understanding situations and acting accordingly. For example, they quickly understand conflicts and reach the best solution. However, the leadership is not extraverted. This enables the leader to maintain a distance between him and employees. For example, he does not attend parties that employees throw at their homes. He has enough conscientiousness. He is very considerate toward ethical and legal issues of a situation. For example, he always pays salaries in time.

 The chief executive, who is actually the leader, is not open to experience. He is shy of trying new things. For example, he sticks to his technique of communicating face-to-face with employees rather than trying video conferencing. Skills Approach “The skills approach takes a leader-centered perspective on leadership”, says Northouse (2010, p.39). The focus shifts from personal fixed qualities to capabilities that are learnt and developed from experience and over a period of time. This approach focuses on the knowledge that is gained by leaders to prove themselves as effective leaders.

 The basic administrative skills that come under this category include technical, human, and conceptual skills (Northouse, 2010, p.39). Technical skills include the competencies gained in a certain area of expertise, such as computer knowledge. Human skills include skills about dealing with people. Conceptual skills are about conceptualizing leadership in terms of learnt competencies. Other skills that are important, as described in the skill model (Northouse, 2010, p.44) are: problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, and gaining a significant knowledge base.

 My organization gives very much importance to the skills approach, and maintains all measures that promote skill of the workforce. The leader shows his need to become authoritative, powerful, and influential. For example, he wants to make his voice heard in front of opposition, and wants to be given value. He is very much achievement oriented. He seeks to achieve his goals through hard work and endurance, and also arranges for suitable training to promote the enhancement of skill in other employees.

 He looks forward to upward progress in his job. He also needs affiliation in that he tries to develop friendly work relations, despite being an introvert. He urges to keep workplace environment happy. For example, he regularly calls all employees individually to himself, listens to their work and family problems, and tries to solve them. Leadership Leadership is the supremacy to stimulate people by words, actions and deeds using vision, faith and honesty. Leadership involves fairly inspiring others to follow guidelines which should consist of both bureaucratic (procedural) and substantive (character-based) aspects.

 The procedural dimension of leadership includes problem-solving and decision-making practice within the circle of ethics. The substantive aspect of leadership includes knowledge, tough standards and guts to pursue directions regardless of opposition. “Ethical leadership predicts outcomes such as perceived effectiveness of leaders, followers’ job satisfaction and dedication, and their willingness to report problems to management”, affirm Brown, Travino and Harrison (2005). If the leadership is thriving, capable and bright, then the outcome is more prolific than anticipated.

 The accomplishment of an organization depends mainly on value-based actions and decisions. The goal of leadership is to make the new comers follow the way the leaders work and behave in the organization. The leaders should show such an attitude at the workplace that would inspire others to follow their directions. Leadership is different from management. “Whereas the study of leadership can be traced back to Aristotle, management emerged around the turn of the 20th century with the advent of our industrialized society”, writes Northouse (2010, p.9). Management involves planning and organizing activities and objectives; while, leadership involves influencing others and creating a vision (Northouse, 2010, p.11).

https://studentshare.org/philosophy/1478598-descartes-doubt,Descartes' Doubt,"Descartes’ doubt Descartes’ doubt Introduction Descartes starts his meditations by asserting that all sciences require an absolute truth. Descartes believes that absolute truth can only be gained by doubting ones beliefs and senses about the truth (Aune, 2013). Descartes asserts that senses are illusionary and hinder the knowledge of the truth. Descartes postulates the cogito by pure thinking and claims that human beings should accept it as the truth. Descartes argues that people discover physical objects by analyzing their own concept of a physical object and not through sense experience (Broughton & Carriero, 2010).

 Descartes suggests that human beings have experiences that produce involuntary ideas (without ones contribution) and include feelings and sensations (Aune, 2013). Descartes recognises that sensations are involuntary thus some external world exists. Descartes attributes sensations to corporeal substance or some other created substance. He tries to explain that all beliefs about the external world are doubtful since they come through senses (Aune, 2013). Exposition Descartes starts his first meditation by doubting all falsehoods he has believed as truth during his life.

 He acknowledges that he has learned through senses and senses can be deceiving. Descartes also claims that things that seem perfect like geometry and arithmetic may be mistaken since an evil genius deceives us (Aune, 2013). In the second meditation, Descartes explores the truth about the of nature of human mind and body. Descartes makes the argument of cogito ergo sum. His truth is that ‘I am thinking, therefore I exist’. Descartes claims that this truth does not emerge from any sensory perceptions or any realities in the external world (Aune, 2013).

 Descartes claims he would exist even when deceived since omnipresent god cannot cause the deception to be truth at the same time. Descartes draws his indubitable truth by claiming that none of his human body has been involved in understanding self (Aune, 2013). Accordingly, he claims that his thoughts are inseparable from conceiving, willing and doubting and he would not exist if he stopped thinking. In his wax analogy, describes the qualities such as size and after melts it and observes the changes that happen (Broughton & Carriero, 2010).

 He surely observes the same wax remains, but questions the substance of the wax. He concludes by asserting that the perception of wax is not on the basis of touching or imagining, but purely inspection on the part of reason and mind (Aune, 2013). Analysis Descartes is not justified at arriving at his indubitable truth. Descartes tries to challenge Aristotelian claim that senses and perceptions lead to truth. Descartes does not offer a logical argument in his philosophical knowledge of truth through meditation.

 Descartes agrees claims only some sense experiences are mistaken, but he does not offer a method of differentiating the correct and mistaken sense experiences. According to his argument, if we doubt that we truly doubt, it follows that we will be making an assumption that the world exists thus his indubitable principle is doomed. Secondly, his claims that knowledge should be limited to absolute certainty make one assume that we can know things without regard to their certainty (Broughton & Carriero, 2010).

 Having explained that he exists since he is thinking, it is clear that is some thing which does the thinking. Descartes could possibly infer his existence from other activities such as ‘I am walking, therefore I exist’. Although Descartes premises his arguments on doubts, he points out it is impossible to doubt that he exists (Aune, 2013). Descartes also asserts that he is dependent on the body and senses since body cannot live without mind yet he denies the existence of any senses (Broughton & Carriero, 2010).

 Descartes asserts that working of the body can be explained by physics and mind is different from the body. However, he fails in conclusively explaining how the mind is different from the body since he only claims that the mind is indivisible and the body is divisible (Aune, 2013). He fails in accounting for how one experiences hunger and other feelings. In his analogy of pilot and the ship, he fails in explaining on a pilot perceives that the ships needs an adjustment and steering when things go wrong.

 Descartes fails to prove the existence of non-deceiving God thus making his reasoning subject to doubt. Descartes reasoning would be uncertain if a supernatural God would manipulate it. Descartes complicates his arguments by asserting that God allows us to be deceived by the external world especially colors and smells of wax. In deed, if God could allow human beings to be deceived then he would allow them to be deceived by the external world (Aune, 2013). The consequences of impossibility of Descartes arguments would create great mind-body dualism problem.

 In addition, there would be a problem on the acceptable standard of truth since absolute truth could not be attainable. Philosophers would also be in disagreement whether omnipresent god could be deceiving human beings through sensory illusions (Aune, 2013). Conclusion Descartes relies on doubting his initially held knowledge to understand the truth. He disputes that senses and feelings are the source of true and asserts that it is through doubting that human beings can have active thinking and know the truth.

https://studentshare.org/history/1478696-what-are-the-central-issues-and-obstacles-to-the,Obstacles To The Reform Of The U.S. Two-Party System,"Obstacles to the reform of the U.S. two-party system Obstacles to the reform of the U.S. two-party system While there have been some minor political parties, also referred to as third parties, in the history of the US, two distinct, competitive parties have exerted their dominance over the American party system. Starting with the Antifederalists and Federalists during the 1790s, the American party system has been characterized by two political parties, which have had the greatest chance of victory during national elections.

 As a matter of fact, since the Civil War, the American political scene has been dominated by two parties, the Republican and Democratic parties. According to Reichley (2000), as a result of the two-party system, all US presidents and nearly all Congressional members elected ever since the Civil War have been either Republicans or Democrats. While the two-party system has characterized US politics, it has not always symbolized the country’s politics. To some extent, the 19th century’s national two-party party system was the combination of one-party states.

 The statewide one party system started to decline in the 20th century, but Democrats sustained one-party supremacy in states in the Deep South until the 1960s and 1970s. Since the emergence of the two-party system, efforts to reform the system have been met with substantial obstacles (Reichley, 2000). The purpose of this paper is to examine the history of reforms to the two-party system, discussing the key obstacles that have impeded these reforms to date. On a few occasions, states have had three-party systems for brief periods.

 For instance, states such as Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin integrated a political party from the Progressive movement into the party systems in the 1930s and 40s. During the 1990s and early 2000s, numerous third-party presidential candidates such as Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan from the Reform Party and the Green Party’s Ralph Nader challenged Republican and Democratic candidates with minimal success (Reichley, 2000). History indicates that reforms of the American two-party system have largely been unsuccessful as a result of the relative nonexistence of irreconcilable differences in the American electorate regarding fundamental economic, social and political institutions.

 In addition, reforms to the two-party system have largely been impeded by the lack of electoral rewards for minor parties, which play a role in the country’s party system. The tradition of plurality elections from one-member constituencies and that of one elected executive provide few chances of victory, as well as rewards, to parties unable to muster this plurality. Lowi (Lowi & Romance, 1998) argues that the incapacity of existing parties to offer sufficient representation for the diverse country is one of the clearest obstacles to reforms of the two-party system.

 Romance (Lowi & Romance, 1998) counters by poising that the two-party system is essential for the unification of a divided country and educates Americans regarding the compromises needed to sustain a democratic government. It is perceptions such as Romance’s that deter reforms of the two-party system as people have grown complacent to the system and consider it as essential for the sustenance of the American society. Byrne & Edsall (1992) argue that the establishment of a three-party system in American politics was curtailed by the Republican revolution of the 1980s, which exemplified Republicans and Democrats as the only relevant parties in American politics.

 Social and political perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the two-party system have curtailed the achievement of reforms of the system. Since the two main parties; Republican and Democratic parties, have been associated with having different stances on issues affecting the society, people have not seen the need for additional parties since both perspectives regarding an issue are covered by the two parties. For instance, if one party endorses the increase of taxes and another decries it, people typically do not see the need for another party offering an alternative opinion.

 On the other hand, according to Piven & Cloward (2000) another obstacle to the reforms of the two-party system is the fact that Americans typically take for granted that the American political system is a model of democracy, which would acknowledge any third party that arises. People have grown so accustomed to having two parties battling for national leadership that they do not appreciate the rights of other parties to join the political arena in seeking office and national leadership. In conclusion, the American political arena will continue to be characterized by two-party rule if the articulated obstacles are not tackled.

 Piven & Cloward (2000) draw compelling parallels that reveal that neither of the two major parties has attempted to appeal to the welfare, as well as interests, of new registered parties. As a consequence, Americans have continued to shun the voting process thus giving power to the existing parties and subtracting from the welfare of newly registered parties. References Byrne, E.

https://studentshare.org/literature/1477403-the-wife-of-bath-in-canterbury-tales,The Wife of Bath in Canterbury Tales,"The Wife of Bath in Canterbury Tales In real life, we find different people with different characters. There are no two people that can have exactly the same character despite the fact that they may have many characters that are similar. Characters that are put in works of art or fiction, be it movies, novels and short stories among others reflect real people in the society because they portray the manner in which people behave in societies. In Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, he introduces the text with a description of twenty-nine characters who are going on a pilgrimage.

 Each Person has a distinct personality that we can relate to real people in the society today. The Wife of Bath is Chaucer’s most delightful character in the text. Chaucer describes her as a skilled weaver who is excellent than the weavers of Ghent and Ypres. She thinks highly of herself and loses her patients easily and fast if any person tries to precede her in making an offering. She is also beautiful as can be seen in Chaucer’s description of her feet, hips, cloths legs and her gap-tooth.

 Chaucer intentionally describes her explicitly to provoke a shocking response as she is also described as a person who goes on a pilgrimage often. These descriptions make the reader wonder whether Alison fits into the Christian values of womanly behavior (Norton 122). In real life, I have met a woman like the Wife of Bath known as Mary. She was my neighbor. She dressed confidently and was not shy. The clothes she put on when going to church made everyone notice her presence adding on to the fact that she was beautiful with a curvaceous body.

 She showed off as a singer knowing she had talent and participated often in church events. However, her participation in church events, her pride and the way she dressed did not reflect a person whose faith and dedication in Christianity was directed purposely to God. It was more of a passion to be noticed, to stand out from other women in church. Whenever one tried to surpass her dressing, singing ability or participation, she would increase her efforts and do more. She had to be in the limelight and no one would make her be the second.

 She wanted and liked to be in control and ahead of every other person in church. This was clearly not because of her religion but dedication towards being in the limelight. Everybody had known her and noticed her way of clothing. On Sundays, everybody expected to see the sparkling Mary and even though people dressed neatly and participated in church no person wanted to be her rival because she did not settle well with that kind. Mary illuminated my understanding of the wife of Bath, Alison. They seem to have the same character.

 Whenever I read Canterbury Tales, I would see Mary in Wife of Bath. The pilgrimages that the wife of Bath makes to Jerusalem, Bologna, Galicia, Rome, and Cologne are characteristic of Mary’s dedicated participation in Church events. Chaucer describes the Wife of Bath as gap-toothed and rides her ambling horse gently and easy. Mary was also gap-toothed. She was truly beautiful. She could not miss the gaze of men who saw her. Some women even envied her beauty and gap-tooth. When one talked to her, you just wanted the talk to last and go on and on so that you would admire her more.

 She owned a small sized car, Mini-Cooper. When she was in it, she drove it as if she never wanted it to get any scratch or be old. It was always clean and she never wanted anybody to lean on it. She would remove even the tiniest mark on its body and make it look as white as snow. This is characteristic of the manner in which the Wife of Bath rides her horse. Unlike the Wife of Bath, she was not married but had been with several suitors. The wife of Bath had been married severally (five times) (Norton 92).

 This makes them similar because they are experienced with men and assume that they have the remedy to love or know much about love because of the experiences that they have had. Their confidence also reflect similarity as the description of the Wife of Bath and the Mary I knew fit as people who never cared or heeded to what people told them. In conclusion, my experiences with Mary greatly influenced my reading of Canterbury Tales and understanding of the Wife of Bath, Alison. The experience shaped my expectations for the reading and the expectations were met as the Wife of Bath acts to control men because of her greed of sex just like Mary was.

https://studentshare.org/management/1477409-reaction-paper,Reaction paper,"Management Outsourcing is the general act whereby one company contracts another to provide services that would otherwise be done by its workers. It may also involve the transfer of workers from one organization to another. Services that are mostly covered in outsourcing includes off shoring which involves relocating a function of a business to another country. The major reasons why companies might outsource is to avoid high taxation rate, high cost of energy and high regulations imposed on it.

 Most of the jobs outsourced in US include; technical support, customer service, accounting, data entry among others. Outsourcing may have both positive and negative impact on the economy of a nation. In my opinion, I agree with the motion mover on the impact of outsourcing such as lowering the personnel cost. For example, according to desk billing data in comparison of salary difference between US and India, US workers are paid roughly $17.50 as compared to Indians who are paid about $11 per hour.

 This then becomes the driving factor for US Companies to outsource human labor from India. Outsourcing also allows companies to focus on competencies. If one company is dealing with a product that does not sell in the market, they might evaluate on their personnel and if need be they might opt to outsource so that they come up with a competent team that can produce superior products. In return, this has the potentiality of improving employee’s productivity as argued by the proposer. However, other research has constantly indicated that outsourcing has been associated with several disadvantages.

 My analysis on this debate is that people might change their occupation when faced with challenges and risks of outsourcing. For instance, the US Bureau of labor statistic did conduct a research on the effect of outsourcing majorly on the occupations such as computer and mathematical occupation showed that outsourcing accounted for was close to 20% of total employment in the US. If this great percentage is affected then country’s population might face a greater challenge on job loss. Further, the US unemployment rate is approximately 7.

6%, with off-shoring accounting for 2% of the service employment in US. This is not a small number, since the same service industry is the largest in US accounting to about 80% of employment therefore thus this might affect US negatively on the labor sector (US Bureau of labor statistics). Another survey according to Mc Kinsey highlights that the percentage of displaced workers who are not employed amount to 31% further consolidating the case on the huge number of people who will be directly affected by outsourcing services.

 I also agree with the proposing side that country risks face losing quality of customer service in its industrial sectors. This is due to the fact that most of the personnel outsourced are not satisfactorily evaluated in terms of their competency and this might result to releasing low quality products to the market. For example, the Dell Company in US was forced to return a call centre operations for some of its products line back to US due to customers’ dissatisfaction in their services. Moreover, outsourcing might also result to a weakened economy.

 This is due to the fact that most of the outsourced workers focus mainly on their salary but not the economy of a given nation. Since they accept low pay, it means that there are fewer taxes collected on such pays. This might lead to decline in the revenue collection of a nation. In addition, the low quality product indeed invites less purchasing power, a direct effect to a company. A weakened economy may pose serious social and economical challenges to a nation. For instance, the high unemployment rate in US is contributed by outsourcing therefore having adverse effects on the livelihoods of local communities.

 From my analysis on the debate, it is evident that a country that faces economic crisis faces high risk of criminal activities and other undesirable social vices. Regarding the question on the impact on the outsourcing to US, I disagree with the proposer on the idea that the horizon of the outsourcing seems to be broadening. To support this, it is important to examine outsourcing against the background of its limitations and challenges that threatens its existence and growth. If this continues then there might be a total collapse on the Economy of US.

 It is very clear that outsourcing makes people divert their career. My view on this is that there will be few people left in some occupation that are mostly outsourced. This might lead to collapse of certain institutions of learning offering the same courses. If this happens, the nation is facing high risk of lack of her own resource personel.US should therefore countercheck this and come up with sustainable long-term corrective mechanisms. The proposer also talked about drug test by outsourced persons from US.

 Yes, it might be advantageous to US, what about the countries who manufacture these drugs? There will be labor competition, which brings negative impact to such nations in their workforce. It is also evident that because of global financial crisis, US is taking back some of its services due to low savings which negatively affect its economy. To conclude my general analysis on the debate is that there are greater disadvantages than advantages on outsourcing. It is very clear that countries that involve in outsourcing might face various economic, social and education challenges.

 United States should therefore look on deeper concepts of outsourcing to avoid the problems discussed. Work cited ""The Employment situation March 2013."" US-Bureau of labor statistics. (2013).",Management,Essay,College
https://studentshare.org/business/1478846-case-report,Rio Tinto Japan,"CASE STUDY Executive Summary Rio Tinto Japan should encourage their employees to work at home instead of going to the office until sufficient information on their safety while travelling back to work shall be provided1. To avoid such unnecessary risk and loss for both the company and the employees, the management team should contact their administration department to create a temporary online space with backup and information regarding the employees’ work for them to work at home without having them to compromise their safety by going to the office.

 In addition, Rio Tinto headquarter in London will have to scale down its operation in Japan and get other affiliated business group to increase their operations for the time being as this shall minimize the losses that will be incurred in Japan. Although times are hard times, if the above steps are taken then Rio Tinto will preserve its most valuable intangible asset, their image, worldwide. Decision Criteria In this case study the manager of Rio Tinto will use the following key decision criteria: 1.

 maintaining customer satisfaction, corporate image- 2. employees safety, morale or turnover, 3. Minimizing the environmental impact. Corporate Objectives Decision Criteria and Metrics Customer satisfaction, corporate image Meeting the demands of their customers Not stopping operation even when it is very hard Keeping their word Employees safety, morale or turnover Allowing employees to work from their homes Training employees to advance their knowledge Better remuneration Minimizing the environmental impact Contracting other companies to help in distribution Identification of the problem The case revealed that there was resistance from each product group on sending their sensitive data to the manager of marketing projects with Rio Tinto marketing secretariat.

 Cause In the business perspective, compiling the KPI data from each product group is critically important to the Rio Tinto company. For instance, in order to market beyond the group, there is need for improving the already existence and profile marketing in the company as this will show how marketing increases value to it. Mr. Yuki, who is the manager, spends about 85% to 90% of his time planning and administering the marketing programs courses. He delivers these marketing courses for training the Rio Tinto employees mostly in the mornings2.

 Despite having diverse locations and culture to operate in, it is important to be patient and persistence, he says, to understand the difference in language, priorities and culture of every individual. This goes along the way in helping the company to ensure that there is no misunderstanding among the individuals, who have different priorities, in the global environment that Rio Tinto operates. Developing Alternatives In developing alternatives for the problems affecting the handling of the business, a key factor to be considered is communication.

 For this reason, it significant for an employer to communicate freely and aptly with his/her employer for a successful results in business. Secondly, the both the administration and workforce ought to resume to work and ensure a mistake is not repeated since it might cause the business to incur a great lose. Rio Tinto will establish a back-up system that will ensure the business does not fail completely by offering a second option when facing difficulties and challenges. The back-up system will also enhance the business to recover from emergencies in cases they might occur unexpectedly.

 Working stuff would have to be treated professionally and maturely in order to boost their morale in delivering splendid results. This can be done by ensuring that their wages and salaries are paid on time and in the correct amount. The administration may offer bonus and gifts for those individuals working and performing well to appreciate their hard work. Further, the suppliers of the Rio Tinto would have to continue with work by playing the role of providing the necessary good for the business according to the terms and conditions.

 This will also go hand in hand in relating to the budget being applied, to ensure that understanding prevails. Solutions The manager will choose customer satisfaction and corporate image as Rio Tinto is a global company that has reputation, which it has built over the time. Secondly, the manger will also choose the alternative of employees’ safety, morale or turnover as this will give the company a good pr as a caring and concerned company3. This will attract future workforce. Lastly, the manager will pick the alternative of minimizing the environmental impact so as not to interrupt their production.

 The best alternative here will be choosing customer satisfaction or corporate image as Rio Tinto is a global company with global market presence. Implications The manager will have to contract other companies to help in supply their products to various companies that rely on them in Japan. In addition, he will allow the employees to work from home until their safety is guaranteed and there must be no layoff whatsoever. All departments of the business ought to ensure they perform well according to their areas of expertise4.

 The management can do this by applying these policies through integrated arrangements and feedback systems. Lastly, another implication to be taken seriously is considering the significance of clients in a business environment. This can be done by ensuring that workers relate well and professionally with clients by teaching them ethics and morals. The good interaction will secure the client and make him/her to come back or invite friends and relatives in the business; hence, boosting sales of the trade.

Communication for product description and establishment of terms of trade towards a transaction’s contract establishment is easier, faster, and cheaper with improved technology and such advantages have been incorporated in businesses.

 Technology has also facilitated commodity access on electronic media and this establishes the scope of e-commerce that conducts trade over electronic systems and computer networks. This paper proposes a research on the role of e-commerce on sustainability and profitability of Small and Medium Sized enterprises. The study will investigate impacts e-commerce on the firms’ ability to withstand environmental challenges and ensure continuity as well as effects on the firms’ profit efficiencies.

 It is necessary in promoting entrepreneurship and economy’s productivity because establishing a significant role of the technological application will facilitate its use among small and medium sized enterprises towards sustainability and profitability benefits. These firms have in the past faced challenges such as poor access to the global market and competition from large-scale enterprises that have sufficient resources for market exploration towards higher sales, revenues, and profitability.

 Identifying e-commerce’s positive impacts on small and medium sized enterprises will therefore promote its application among the firms and empower them to access a diversified market and increase their productivity towards high profitability levels and higher rate of economic growth among their economies. Literature review Technological applications identify efficiencies and effectiveness that facilitate objectives and such expectations apply to the use of e-commerce by businesses. The role of e-commerce in global market access has been established and significance of e-commerce drivers ascertained.

 Internal factors to e-commerce such as transferability of products over electronic systems and availability of commodities that can be traded over electronic media improves a firm’s marketability and its distribution potentials. Internal e-commerce drivers also improve pricing strategies and moderates effects of the drivers on export market (Gregory, Karavdic and Zou, 2007). A study to investigate effects of e-commerce competencies on success of e-commerce enterprises in Thailand established that the competencies empower retailing firms and facilitate success in e-commerce activities.

 The technology application also identifies improved marketing in which customers, technology firms and personnel, and awareness processes in the technology’s application play significant marketing roles. Benefits of e-commerce on organizations are further identifiable through its independence from technological variations, a factor that boosts marketability and success during market turbulence as compared to physical trading that only relies of real market factors. This identifies diversification of market risks (Chailom and Mumi, 2012; Jantarajaturapath and Ussahawanitchkit, 2009).

 Literature review of case studies on application of e-commerce also identifies its significance to small and medium sized enterprises whose market environment is competitive. E-commerce is for example a remedy to declining sales and motivates employees but its direct significance on profitability is not ascertained (Barkley, Lamie and Markley, 2007). Little focus has however been made on the effects of e-commerce on the ability of small and middle-sized enterprises to ensure their sustainability and profitability.

 This paper therefore proposes a study to investigate derivable sustainability and profitability benefits, from e-commerce application, by the small and middle-sized businesses. Methodology The study will use a quantitative research method with an experimental research design. Application of e-commerce will be the treatment effect and the dependent variable while sustainability and profitability will be dependent variables. Same firms will be used in non-seasonal sectors. The firms will operate without application of e-commerce for four months within which trends in their profitability as well as their sustainability will be measured.

 The firms will then be trained on e-commerce and monitored for another four months under the technology’s application. Application of e-commerce and sustainability will be measured on ordinal scale while profitability will be measured on ratio scale based on net profit margin. Survey will be used in data collection with the aid of self-administered survey questionnaires. The following questions will derive participants’ responses. Has your enterprise been using e-commerce in the past four months?

 What were your firm’s net profit margins for the past four months? On an ordinal scale of one to five one implies poor and the value five implies excellent, grade your enterprise’s monthly sustainability level. Research participants will be a group of firms that meets the criteria for small and medium sized enterprises. Thirty firms will be selected based on an inclusion criterion of non application of e-commerce strategy. Simple random sampling approach will be used (Gravetter and Forzano, 2011).

 Proposed data analysis techniques Data analysis will be achieved through application of SPSS software to determine significance of the relationship between application of ecommerce strategy and profitability and sustainability of organizations. Expected results The study expects to establish significant positive effects of e-commerce on the organizations’ profitability and sustainability because of the advantages such as efficiency and effectiveness, and ability to increase sales volume.

Life objectives are defined by goals that one set throughout their life. In this consideration, I have set up goals that I hope to achieve through healthy living, education, and career advancements. Setting goals help me to measure my progress and determine my current position relative to where I want to be. Personal Goals: Lower My Cholesterol Lowering my cholesterol level is one of my main personal health goals.

 Ever since I noticed that my body is susceptible to accumulation of cholesterol, I have not done much to correct the situation until recently that I noticed that I have a serious problem. The main problem is that buildup of cholesterol levels within my body continues to affect me into the long-term. Moreover, the problem is cumulative and therefore I have to attend to it immediately. My main objective is to lower my body cholesterol from the current 6.2 mol/L to less than 5.5 mol/L. I am certain that I will achieve this objective through a combination of measures that I expect to be helpful.

 Firstly, I need to reduce the intake of fatty foods particularly meat by over 70%. In addition, I will reduce meat in my diet and increase the intake of fruits and vegetables. I also hope to increase my exercise time from the current 40 minutes per day to 2 hour per day. My exercise routine will include both jogging and body relaxation exercises. I hope to be successful in my diet and exercise routine. I expect to have positive results within the first two months of intensive training and regulated diet.

 The main indicator of success will be reduced exhaustion level and increased body activity. I will also undertake medical tests to establish my body cholesterol levels. Academic Goals Academic success is a major determinant of successful living. Throughout my life, I have continuously set academic goals that I hope to achieve by the end of the year 2014. My main academic goal is to complete my degree in business in June 2014. Besides my undergraduate degree, I expect to identify a research project that will further into my postgraduate studies.

 Therefore, I hope to complete all my undergraduate exams successfully and attain high grades. Measures or determinants for this goal include passing of examination and establishing the right connection with my tutors and peers. To achieve these goals I will be required to; Increase my study hours from the current 2-3 hours to 4 hours per day I will also need to increase my level of participation in class discussions and other classroom activities I will also need to increase my level of interaction with my fellow students I will also need to improve my research skill by learning the current research practices and software Achieving these subsidiary goals will enable me to achieve my main academic objective.

 These objectives will coincide with my current academic calendar. Measures for these objectives are definite and they will be dependent on the level of success on each of the objectives listed above. Cumulative achievement will be the completion of my studies and achievement of my business degree by 2014. My Professionally Goals Following successful completion of my undergraduate studies, I have career objectives that I must achieve. My career goals are independent of my academic goals despite the fact that they are closely related.

 For instance, my career objectives are a life necessity while my academic objectives are not a life necessity although they are important. My main professional goal is to set a daycare center in a middle class neighborhood by June 2015. The daycare center should be up and running by January 2016. I hope to have achieved 50% of the desired enrolment by then. Not only do I need to open and run a daycare center but also I need to open a modern center with up-to-date facilities. I also need to run a daycare center that caters for the wholesome development of children.

 This objective will be measured by evaluating the level of progressiveness of the center in terms of overall intake and provision of exceptional care to the children. Alternative measures of success will be pegged on positive reviews by parents and other supporters. I will also need to secure legal registration and documentation for my daycare center within the first month of operation. Lastly, I expect the daycare center to be self-reliant in terms of finances within the first five months of operation.

 I look forward to achieving my personal, academic, and professional goals as outlined in this objective declaration. Through hard work, dedication and consultation I expect to achieve my goals within the set constraints.",Psychology,Essay,High School
https://studentshare.org/music/1483915-franz-schubert,Franz Schubert,"Franz Schubert of the Music of the Concerned August 4, Franz Schubert was an Austrian musical genius who composed some of the marvellous compositions at the cusp of the Classical and the Romantic age. The musical career of Franz Schubert was marked by immense versatility and ingenuity and his compositions continue to inspire the generations to come. Though bound by a sad and poverty ridden life, Franz Schubert is known to be one of the most talented composers of all times. Franz Schubert Franz Schubert happened to be an early Romantic composer of Austrian origins who was born on 31 January 1797 (McKay, 1997).

 Schubert turned out to be an utterly versatile and prolific composer who contrived many memorable compositions in his short life span of 32 years. Though during his lifespan, Franz Schubert accrued little public acclaim and appreciation, yet, the interest in his compositions immensely increased in the decades that followed his death in 1828 (McKay, 1997). Schubert happened to be a profusely melodious composer and is considered to be one of the greatest composers of all time. Franz Schubert’s father Franz Theodor Schubert was a humble school master (McKay, 1997, p. 4). His mother, Elizabeth Vietz served in Vienna as a domestic help (McKay, 1997, p. 10). Right from the childhood, Franz Schubert’s family encouraged his interest and talent in music and at a nascent stage he received violin lessons from his father, elder brother and the organist at the local church (McKay, 1997, p. 11). By the dint of his budding talent Schubert got selected in the choir of Royal Seminary and the Imperial Court Chapel, where he was considered to be an outstanding student (McKay, 1997, p. 254). It is a sad fact that though Schubert started composing music at a very early age, this reticent, shy and talented young man was never able to secure any viable permanent employment and most of his life either he was supported by his friends or employed by his father and well wishers.

 This great composer made significant contribution to piano, chamber and orchestral music (Black, 2003, p. 111). The compositions of Franz Schubert influenced a whole generation of composers that came after him. Yet, the genius of Schubert rendered most prolific service to Lieder that are the German art songs for piano and voice, of which he composed nearly 600 samples (Black, 2003). Besides, in his brief but productive life Franz Schubert also composed an array of operas, piano music, chamber music, symphonies, masses and sonatas (Black, 2003).

 Franz Schubert endowed the world of music with some of the most enchanting melodies that are a joy to listen to even in the contemporary times, though only a meagre of his compositions got published during his life time. Thereby, Franz Schubert is not known for the public acclaim he accrued during his lifetime, but is rather remembered for the heavenly compositions that stood the test of time and will continue to inspire the generations to some. The virtuosity of Franz Schubert lies in his ability to seamlessly bridge the gap between the Classical and the Romantic age, through a dextrous use of natural imagery, sweet melody, and ingenious scoring that not only neatly blended with the regular Classical forms, but rather proceeded ahead to expand and build on them (Reed, 1997, p. 105). Schubert’s talent and capacity for contriving sweet melodies remains unsurpassed in the overall history of the Western Music.

 Franz Schubert’s music is primarily given to bold harmonic writing with a predominant stress on the major/minor key shifts (Reed, 1997). It goes without saying that the compositions of Schubert tend to be quiet elusive and subtle that are marked by a distinct sense of passion laced intricately with a melodious genre of darkness and sadness (Clive, 1997). Yet, as already said, Schubert is best known for his contribution to German Lieder. Schubert’s songs tend to be the shining examples of a unique dramatic and poetic grace, attributed primarily to his capacity and talent for choosing the poems drafted by some of the most melodious poets of his times, his inspired sense of melody, and his intricate rendering of the piano parts (Clive, 1997).

 It is not without a reason that Schubert is attributed for inspiring some of the famous later day composers like Hugo Wolf and Johannes Brahms. Some of the famous works of Franz Schubert include The Fifth Symphony, the unfinished Eighth Symphony, many pianoworks for four hands, and the Six Moments Musicaux that are rich in feeling and expression and were written during the last phase of his career (Grout & Palisca, 2001). Some of the well known songs composed by Schubert are Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt weiss was ich leide, his most famous song Heidenroslein, the well known song with a strongly emotive appeal that is Der Erlkonig and the melodious and soulful song Gretchen am Spinnrade (Grout & Palisca, 2001).

 It would not be wrong to say that the musical career of Franz Schubert happened to be meteoric that though being short and constrained was marked by an immense prolificacy, talent and creativity.

https://studentshare.org/english/1483977-climate-change,Climate change,"College: Climate Change Human beings’ lives on earth are greatly guaranteed by the presence of air in the atmosphere which is very essential to any life. Favourable environment, climate and weather significantly contributed to the creation of cosmic bio-diversity in land, ocean and air; however climate is most essential for the safe and risk free existence of every life whether animal life, human life or even plant life. Significantly, climate change predictions give man knowledge of the future; and these predictions cannot compared to magic, neither are they opinions or speculations.

(Ricky, 2008, 1) Climate predictions are based on investigation in the field of science i.e. physics of the earth’s atmosphere and also inclusive of chemistry and biology. Even though they are different uncertainties in climate change predictions, the core of the predictions is of very little doubt since they are based ultimately in observations which are formed into testable theories; the theories are expressed in form of mathematical expressions which are solved to give predictions. (Vishal, 2013, 1) Today climatologists’ main concerns are climate change and its impact; for instance global warming is being noticed around the world due to climate change.

 As of today, global warming is the greatest problem facing planet earth and is in fact the temperature increase of the earth’s neon surface air on top of being the most current and widely discussed factors concerning climate. Global warming has a far reaching impact on the bio-diversity and earth’s climate conditions; it is clearly demonstrated by a couple of trends that it has a direct impact on noteworthy worldwide climate changes, the melting of ice caps and rising sea levels which is a clear indication of the threat that global warming poses to all living things.

 Global average temperature has significantly been rising over the years, which has been caused by the increase in atmospheric gas concentrations from activities by humans and as a result the world is getting warmer and warmer every year. Due to the imbalance that humans have made between earth and their lives, there has been a series of disaster signs like drought, tsunami, cyclones, landslides etc and if the imbalance persists to rise, existence of the planet will be questioned.(Mohammad, 2013, 1) Carbon dioxide, an imperative component of the environment causes a warming effect on the surface of the earth thus increasing the evaporation of water into the atmosphere hence causing more warming since water vapour is also a green house gas.

 The carbon dioxide level is likely to rise in the future due to the continued land use change and combustion of relic fuels; however the rate at which the levels will rise will be determined greatly by developments on ground like; technology, economy and other natural developments. Increase in the use of other gases like CFCs, methane and nitrous oxide, which are also accountable for global warming, has been caused by explosive population growth, deforestation, technological advancement and growing urbanisation.

 Trees are considered to be the largest land-based mechanism for eliminating carbon dioxide from the air and thus play a significant role in global carbon cycle; however deforestation, the second principle cause of atmospheric carbon dioxide, is scrutinizing these positive processes. (Vishal, 2013, 1) Global warming and population growth also have a very close relation, and today the large numbers of population are using the different technologies which are disparaging for the earth. Moreover, a large portion of carbon release is accredited to the combustion of gasoline in vehicles engines; poor gas mileage vehicles contribute greatly to global warming.

 (Mohammad, 2013, 1) Global temperatures increase will lead to rise in sea level hence causing the melting of glaciers, frequency of extreme weather and change in rainfall patterns; it is said that the shrinking of glaciers is going to create a major challenge to drinking water. The increasing concerns over global temperatures have put nations, corporations and states on a high alert forcing some to figure out ways of forestalling the condition. Many ways and ideas of overcoming the situation have been brought forward; nevertheless very few of these ideas have been implemented by individuals or states showing that not everyone takes the overwhelming effects seriously.

 Significantly, forestation can be of great impact in this regard where there is planting of more trees and reducing instances of cutting down of trees worldwide which will help restore the imbalance. (Vishal, 2013, 1) Moreover, the environmental policy of reuse, reduce and recycle should be followed while the use of fossil fuels should be discouraged to prevent the emission of harmful gases. All the same every individual should be fully informed on the rationale of preserving the environment and eco-friendly technologies should substitute the gases emitting technologies. .

https://studentshare.org/sociology/1484012-gun-control,Gun Control,"Gun Control Violence, gun control, and gun rights have become the most popular issues in the current events. These have continued to raise a debate, and have borne considerable controversies. The people in the United States are highly divided, with regard to these issues. While some support gun control, others support gun rights. Nonetheless, gun control includes the laws, rules, and regulations, which restrict the manufacture, sale, ownership, and use of guns. On the other hand, gun rights mainly advocate for the possession and use of guns for defense purposes.

 The measures in gun control range from bans on different types of firearms, to the licensing of those individuals wishing to possess guns. Nonetheless, in the debate about gun control, there are two main sides, the opposing, and the supporting sides. Each side has its key leaders, and members have their own valid reasons for the stand they have taken. The main supporters of gun control are the Democrats, while those opposed to gun control are the Republicans. Therefore, while the democrats have held the anti-gun campaigns, the Republicans have supported the gun rights.

 However, there is a considerable division, since not all the Republicans support gun rights, and not all the Democrats support gun control. According to Reinhard, although President Obama, who is a Democrat, emphasizes that the gun control laws are aimed at the Republicans, there are a considerable number of his party members, who have in the past supported gun rights (Web). Therefore, the obstacles to gun control in the United States are not the Republicans only, but also some Democrats. However, it is clear that most Democrats support gun control, while most Republicans are ardent supporters of gun rights.

 These two groups have different reasons that motivate them to choose their position on this issue. In a recent research by Pew Research Center, findings have shown that 49 to 42 percent of Americans believe that limiting gun ownership is more important than protecting gun owners. This survey is the first, since Obama’s presidency, to show that many Americans valued gun control, as compared to gun rights (Reinhard Web). Nonetheless, the reasons different people hold for supporting or opposing gun control are motivated either politically, culturally, or by the people’s religious beliefs.

 Apart from the political class, there are major non-profit organizations, which mainly campaign for or against gun control. These include the National Rifle Association and the Brady Campaign. The National Rifle Association support gun rights. This is because of the major reason that gun control violates individuals’ constitutional rights to gun ownership. On the other hand, Brady Campaign supports gun control because of the major reason that this will alleviate the level of gun violence in the United States.

 According to Reinhard (Web), the issue of gun control has immense political importance in the United States. Therefore, this issue does not only serve the function of focusing on the safety of citizens in the country. The decision of a politician in the United States to support or oppose gun control has great political implications for him or her. For this reason therefore, depending on the state, and the views of the majority people in the state about gun control, a politician will base on these to decide his or her standing, as far as the issue of gun control is concerned.

 For instance, Reinhard gives the example of Al Gore, who in the year 2000 lost the presidential election. This was for the main reason that being a democrat; he supported gun control, for which most citizens were opposed to. Since most people in the United States seem to be opposed to gun control, Reinhard claims that the Democrats have neither emphasized nor popularized their campaigns on gun control, for fear of losing supporters of their party (Web). Nonetheless, for those people supporting gun control, their main reason is that this would result in harmony and peace in American cities.

 Different cases have shown that people who own guns tend to use them irresponsibly during conflicts and when under the influence of alcohol. In addition, the major aim of gun control is to curb violence. Therefore, supporters of gun control feel that this is not only aimed at disarming, but safety of the people is the greatest deal. Gun control is also emphasized by supporters because they believe that his will also lower levels of suicide, in which guns are used. Nonetheless, since guns are considered more lethal than most weapons, the gun control supporters believe that this will help to lower crime levels and other negative repercussions of gun use in society.

 On the other hand, the group opposed to gun control believes that this limits the capability of individuals for self-defense. In addition, some states in the United States have been using firearms for recreational purposes, such as target shooting and hunting. Therefore, gun control would end these historical recreational activities. Most importantly, the advocates of gun rights consider gun control to deny citizens their constitutional right of exercising self-defense. Conclusively, gun control continues to be highly debated today.

 Americans are divided on the issue of gun ownership. Those that support this might be politically motivated, or influenced by their social experiences or religious convictions. Nonetheless, most Democrats are believed to support gun control. Similarly, those people against gun control are influenced either by political standing. Nonetheless, in this debate, there can be no right or wrong side, as both sides have their reasons, which they consider valid.

https://studentshare.org/business/1484116-legal-contracts,Legal contracts,"Legal contracts Legal contracts Contract in common terms is known as an agreement between two parties that can be enforced by law and involves considerations. It is very important to know that how a contract is formulated. It starts when a person shows his willingness to do or abstain from any act to another person who is willing to accept his offer this is known as a ‘proposal’. When accepted by the other person it becomes a promise, which is transformed in to an agreement when valid considerations are set by both parties.

 An agreement becomes a contract when it is enforceable by the law; an agreement that is not enforceable is a void. This paper highlights different kinds of contracts like void contracts, voidable contracts, unilateral contracts, bilateral contracts, express contracts, implied contracts and it also sheds light on some examples of valid considerations. There are certain elements that must be present at time of forming a contract. There are three main elements of a contract; offer, acceptance and considerations.

 An offer is when one party promises another party to do or abstain from doing some act in return for a favor. Acceptance is the process when the offer is accepted by the other party. When it is all decided and agreed upon both parties set up considerations. A consideration is an act or return promise that each party makes with the other party before making the contract. Some examples of valid considerations are a promise for an act, an act in exchange for an act or a promise for a promise. For example if Mr.

 A offers Mr. B $100 if he washes his car. This is a valid consideration where one party is getting money for accepting the contract whereas the other party is getting a favor in terms of getting his car cleaned. A void contract in reality is not a contract at all; it is not enforceable by the law. A contract may become void if the three elements are not fulfilled. There are certain cases in which if any contracts are made are considered void. These circumstances include contracts with unlawful consideration, contracts that restraint a party from marriage, trade or legal proceeding is also labeled as a void contract.

 On the other hand; voidable contracts are proper contracts but are such where one party is bound by the contract but the other party may have the authority to reject the contract. These contracts include contracts that are made by coercion, fraud, under influence or by misrepresentation. A unilateral contract is such a contract where parties exchange a promise for an act. Such is a contract where a party promises some kind of consideration example money or any promise in exchange for an act that the other party has to do.

 These contracts are also known as one sided contracts as only the party that has made the promise and has offered something is bound by the law to complete the contract. A bilateral contract is also known as a two sided contract where both parties are bound by the law to complete the contract. It is a mutual exchange of promises, performance of an act or restriction of an act. And these promises are enough consideration for the other party to make this contract enforceable. An express contract is one where all elements of the contract, the agreement, acceptance and consideration, are clearly stated when the contract is drawn up.

 These terms may be written down or orally accepted by both parties. It is a very rigid kind of contract where the offeree accepts the agreement where he explicitly agrees to the terms mentioned. An implied contract is a different kind of contract than an express one. An implied contract is a contract where the contract is not agreed upon in verbal terms but it is an agreement of the minds and something that is implied according to the surrounding circumstances and the relationship between parties.

 These types of contracts are made up from inference (made from meeting of minds) rather than from explicitly formed contracts. The United States Supreme Court in the case of Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. United States recognized that such contracts do exist and are enforceable by the law.

https://studentshare.org/business/1481328-foreign-exchange-exposure-concepts-of-foreign,Foreign Exchange Exposure - Concepts of Foreign Currency and Exchange Rates,"Contents Concepts of Foreign Currency and Exchange Rates 2 Concept of Currency Exposure Risk, Translation Exposure, and Economic Exposure 2 Mathematical Illustration 4 Risk Management Techniques 4 References 6 Concepts of Foreign Currency and Exchange Rates The global operations of any multinational require it to actively participate in international trade which causes it to be exposed to a great deal of foreign exchange risks. These companies engages in international trade through foreign exchange forward contracts and options and cross currency swaps to hedge various currency exposures.

 These exposures primarily include assets, liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currency. Effective financial management requires identification of risks and taking effective measures in order to curb them. This requires evaluating the exposure of the multinational company and the corresponding risk. International exposure of the multinational companies can be defined as the value of its assets and liabilities, presented in its functional (primary) currency, exposed to the change in the foreign interest rates, exchange rates and inflation rates.

 Concept of Currency Exposure Risk, Translation Exposure, and Economic Exposure The foreign risk exposure can be classified into two broad categories. Transaction Exposure; and Translation Exposure Transaction exposure can be defined as the risk arising due to the unanticipated change in the exchange rate which affects the cash inflow or outflow at the time of the settlement of an asset or liability. An important factor to consider in these types of risks is that the foreign currency value in such circumstances is fixed and thus these types of risks are also termed as contractual exposure.

 On the other hand, translation exposure arises due to the operation of the accounting and legislative standards which requires the foreign currency balances of assets and liabilities appearing in the balance sheet, to be revalued at the closing spot rate. These assets are of the time which is not going to be liquated in the near future. Translation risk, which is also termed as the accounting risk, is basically the related measure of variability. [Grant, K. & Marshall, A. P., 1997] Exchange rate can be defined as the relative price of one currency in terms of other.

 The exchange rate plays a very significant role in determining the capital flows and investments between international boundaries. In order to exercise prudent financial management, it is of prime importance for the multinationals to forecast the future exchange rates so that they do not suffered exchange losses and incur additional liability. Multinational companies, in order to curb the foreign exchange risk exposure enter into hedging transaction which means reducing or controlling risk. In hedging transaction, the firm take place a position in the future market which is opposite to the one being taken in the spot market.

 The underlying objective of the hedging is to reduce or limit the risk associated with the change in the exchange rate. For example, if an American company has an obligation to pay ?100 in month time and currently the exchange rate parity between USA and UK is ?1 is equal to $1.5, currently in its principal currency, $, the American company has the obligation of paying $150. Now if the financial managers of the American company forecast that the exchange rate parity between USA and UK will be ?

1 to $2, then the company will be liable to pay $200 and thus will have to pay $50 more due to the fluctuation in exchange rate. In order to cater this situation, the company can enter into a hedging transaction whereby it enters into a transaction where it has to receive ?100 in one month, so that the loss on payable is offset by the gain on receivables. There are several types of foreign currency risk hedging. The most common types of foreign currency hedges that can be observed are the foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options.

 In forward contracts, the settlement of the transaction is contracted at a rate which is decided beforehand at a rate which is termed as the forward rate. On the other hand, in foreign currency options, the owner has the right to buy or sell a particular amount of the currency at a rate which is predetermined on the purchase date. There is no obligation in the case of foreign currency options, whereas the forward foreign currency contracts are binding. Other forms of hedges are money market hedge and foreign currency swaps.

 Mathematical Illustration In the above mentioned case, DGP Inc. records sale of US$ 138,680 as the parity between the US$ and Euro is 1 EUR is equal to 1.3868 US$. Now after the end of 30 days, if the interest rate parity moves to 1.2868USD, then the company would receive 128,680USD at the time of settlement of the debt and would also record a corresponding exchange loss in the profit and loss account amount to 10,000 USD i.e. difference between the accounts receivable US$ 138,680 and cash actually received US$ 128,680.

 Similarly, if at the end of 20 days, the exchange rates between Euro and USD moves to 1.4868 the DGP Inc. would receive 148,680USD and would also record an exchange gain of 10,000 USD in its profit and loss account i.e. difference between the accounts receivable US$ 138,680 and cash actually received US$ 148,680. Risk Management Techniques Hedging can be regarded as the most commonly used method when it comes to risk aversion and avoidance techniques. In financial terminology, hedge can be defined as an investment position the primary reason of which is to offset probable losses arising from a related investment position.

 In general terms, the analogy of hedging can be made with insurance. In insurance people safeguard themselves against a loss that can take place due to any uncertain event that is liable to take place in the future. Although insurance does not averse the risk from taking place, it assists in curtailing the impact of it. In the dynamic financial world of today, hedging is practiced by investment bankers, portfolio managers, individual investors and other corporations. From the look of it, hedging can appear to be quite a simple transaction, but in reality it is quite a complex arrangement.

 The primary reason for using hedging is to guard against the adverse price movement in the financial markets through the use of instruments. [Haight, T.G., and Kehly, J.C.Jr. (1995),] The following table summarizes the risk and methods used to curtail them. Exposure Hedging Through Exchange rate exposure Forward Contracts, Future Contracts, Foreign Currency Swaps and Options Interest rate Exposure Interest rate swaps and options Commodity rate change exposure Cash Flow Hedges and Commodity Swaps In the mentioned case study, the company can enter into a forward contract where it enter into an agreement with the corresponding party that the settlement of the transaction would take place at the 30 days forward rate of 1.3868. Now, no matter whatever the exchange rate prevails in the market between EURO and USD, the transaction would take place at 1.3868. Another example of hedging against the adverse exchange rate movement would be to buy a currency option.

 Options are better than the forward currency contract as they are not binding and it is upon the discretion of the holder whether or not to exercise the option. In the mentioned case, the company can buy a put currency option by paying an upfront premium and then wait for the 30th date in order to assess whether the option should be exercised or not.

 Whereas many individuals already have a clear indication of what their major will be, I had no clear indication upon even my soft more year of high school as to what that might be. This is not say that certain subjects did not interest me; they did. Rather, it is merely to assert that I found it difficult to imagine myself passionately pursuing any course of study based upon the ones that I was currently introduced to within the standard high school curriculum. As anyone who has attended high school can attest, standard high school curriculum is most closely associated with reading, writing, arithmetic, and standard sciences (to include chemistry, physics, and biology).

 Once again, even though these interested me, they were not something that captured my imagination or intrigued me to pursue as a potential career choice and/or college major in the future. However, upon my junior year, I signed up for a course in information technology. Although I have always been somewhat talented and gifted in computers and software applications, I had never considered information technology as a potential career choice; or even choice of major for that matter. Yet, the subject matter itself, although intriguing, was not ultimately what encouraged me to the greatest degree.

 As a result of an exceptional teacher, Mr. Watkins, I was introduced to a broad and deep level of information that I had previously only scratched the surface of. To me, such a reality was unique due to the fact that prior to attending high school I was of course aware of the fact that mathematics and science is as well as literature and the arts were an accident parts of the world and is necessarily defined the means by which the human experience and achievement took place. Conversely, prior to signing up for and participating in this for Watkins information technology class, I have little if any for knowledge of the range and depth that the complexity of information technology could afford anyone who studied it.

 What this meant was that Mr. Watkins was able to open up a range of subject matter expertise and material that I was otherwise unaware of and this intrigue me to an extent that the other subjects which have been discussed thus far in this analysis could not. By realizing the fact that real-life applications could be made infinitely more efficient and the information which I was gaining could be applied to a host of different real-world situations, the subject matter that Mr. Watkins presented became all the more engaging.

 However, beyond merely the intriguing nature of the subject matter, Mr. Watkins served as a mentor and perennial encouragement with regards to the way in which students could potentially integrate with the information and apply it to their daily lives stop as compared to many of the other professors and teachers that I had previously, or have had cents, Mr. Watkins ability to expand otherwise boring subject material and bring it into the real world applicable a that made it relevant was one of the most unique facets that encouraged me to pursue this as a major in college.

 Moreover, the encouraging spirit and means by which Mr. Watkins regularly made himself available to the student to encourage and tutor them outside of class served as yet another encouragement for me. Although it cannot be definitively stated that my experience in Mr. Watkins high school information technology class has been replicated in each and every one of my college experiences, it can be stated that the formative encouragement and mentorship that I received as a result of this particular high school class has been able to encourage and bolster my confidence even during course work and applications that I would otherwise find highly tedious and otherwise uninteresting.

 Ultimately, as a result of Mr. Watkins mentorship and encouragement, I have decided to pursue a major in networking. Realizing that the world of the future will not only rely upon the baseline of information that has been presented to students in high school and colleges over the past hundred years, Mr. Watkins encouraged me, and doubtless other students, to think outside the box and pursue a major that has a number of real world applications and high demand within the current economy.",English,Essay,College
https://studentshare.org/human-resources/1481461-application-exercise-a,Application Exercise (A-1) Due 7.14.13,"and number Assignment number and Contents Introduction 3 Level Reaction 4 Level 2- Learning 4 Level 3- Evaluations 5 Level 4- Value to the organization 5 Reference 6 Introduction In case of evaluating the effectiveness of a training program it is appropriate to use the four-level model by Donald Kirkpatrick. This model says that the method of evaluation should always start with the bottom level and then, with the gradual passage of time and with increased funds, the method should move successively through the next levels that is level two, three & four.

 Feedback from each prior stage serves as the foundation for the subsequent level's evaluation. Thus, each following level signifies a more specific determination of the efficiency of the training program, but at the same time needs a more precise and prolonged analysis (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2007) The four levels are- Level 1 evaluations- This step is also known as reaction as this level measures the initial reaction of the employees towards the training program. This method mostly takes the help of surveys.

 Level 2 evaluations- This is the learning step as it measures the amount of information that has been learnt by the participants. This phase is usually evaluated by the application of criterion-referenced tests. Level 3 evaluations- It’s the transfer phase that measure the amount of skills learned by the participants are actually being used in the day to day work. The transfer phase is mostly reviewed by the methods like interviews with co-workers and supervisors & observations. Level 4 evaluations- It refers to the value to the organization.

 It is the determination of the financial investment on the training session in terms of the outcome faced by the organization. The assessment for this level doesn’t have a clear definition. Let’s discuss the four levels in details: Level 1- Reaction 1. Evaluation at this stage assesses how the employees who took part in the training program react to it. The employees are given a feedback-form immediately after the session is over. These forms tries to find out the answer to the questions like did the trainer answer all your questions?

 How much helpful was the training session? Was the infrastructure adequately supportive? Etc. Kirkpatrick states that, all training programs should at least be analyzed at this level to gather the relevant information needed for the further improvement of the program (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2007). Moreover, the participants' feedbacks have got significant impact for the next level in the model that is the learning level. Even though a positive response does not assure learning, a negative response almost definitely eliminates its possibility.

 Level 2- Learning Evaluation at this stage pushes the assessment beyond the learner contentment and tries to study the degree to which the employees have developed with reference to skills, attitude & knowledge. Measurement at this tier becomes more complicated and lengthy than tier one. Measurement procedures range from formal to informal methods of examining to team appraisal and self-assessment. It is likely that the employees take the assessment or test before the training session which is known as pretest and if they take it after the training then it is called as post test, both of which are devised to verify the amount of learning that has taken place.

 Supervisors are therefore given the task of monitoring the progress of the employee after training has been imparted to them. The supervisors simply monitor whether the employees are applying the tools & techniques learnt through the training program. Level 3- Evaluations This level evaluates the transmission of training material that has occurred in the employee’s behavior as a result of the training program. Assessment at this phase tries to answer questions like - Are the newly acquired skills, knowledge, or attitude being used in the everyday environment of the learner?

 Are their jobs getting easier with the implementation of various tactics that has been provided to them through the training program? For many corporate trainers this phase exhibits the actual measurement of a program's success. However, measurement at this level becomes complex as it often becomes unattainable to forecast when the change in attitude will take place, and thus needs key decisions in the context of how to evaluate, how often to evaluate & when to evaluate. Level 4- Value to the organization This phase is often considered as the bottom line.

 This level deals with the measurement of success of the training session with reference to the perspectives of the managers and executives who consider improved quality, reduced frequency of accidents, increased production, increased sales, decreased costs, and even higher profits or return on investment as the standards for measuring the effectiveness of the session. From the business and organizational viewpoint, this is the overall cause behind a training session, yet tier four results are not usually addressed.

 Estimating the results in monetary terms is not easy to measure, and is difficult to connect directly with the training imparted. Reference Kirkpatrick, D.L. & Kirkpatrick, J.D. (2007) Implementing the Four Levels. USA: Berrett-Koehler Publishers.",Human Resources,Essay,High School
https://studentshare.org/history/1481516-colony-irish-and-irish-famine-as-genocide,Colony Irish and Irish famine as genocide,"Ireland as the First Colony, Irish Famine as Genocide Insert Insert Grade Insert Insert Introduction Ireland was the first British colony. Even though Ireland had been dependent on Britain it officially became the British colony in the 17th century. After the country was being conquered, England sourced cheap raw materials and food from it. Ireland being famous for cattle rearing exported half a million head to England by 16601. In 1666 the British government passed a law that prohibited the export of cattle and its products to England.

 The people of Ireland substituted this with the export of Sheep which was also later prohibited. The British imperialists also destroyed the Ireland clothing industry. Export of products in Ireland was paralysed and instead replaced by export of humans to developed countries like Britain and USA. The English landowners grabbed a lot of land in Ireland leaving most of the Irish citizens as squatters who had no security. The imperial policies reduced the citizens of Ireland to poverty leading to migration to other countries.

 The famous great Irish famine of 1845 to 1849 could be said to be manmade because at this time food was being exported from Ireland by the colonialists while the Irish citizens were starving to death2. Moreover, Britain was one of the wealthiest countries in Europe and yet it left millions of citizens in Ireland to starve to death. This paper looks at why the great Irish famine could be compared to genocide. Discussion Genocide can be defined as intentional extermination of a cultural, racial or political group.

 This is done by deliberately exposing the group to life conditions that leads to destruction of part or whole of the group. Based on the above definition let us look at the famine scenario of Ireland. The people of Ireland had depended on potatoes as their staple food. This is because potatoes could grow under poor conditions and required very little labour. The attack of potatoes by potato blight was a big blow to the citizens of Ireland. This led to famine in Ireland and by summer of 1847 about half of the Irish population was depending on relief food.

 Many people died in a short time in that burial was sometimes done in mass graves. Then how could this natural calamity be comparable to genocide? The first issue we look at are the food alternatives. In 1845, that is the year which famine started, a substantial amount of corn was exported from Ireland to Britain. In the same year 257, 257 sheep were exported by the imperialists to Britain. The following year 186,843 oxen and 480,827 swine were exported to Britain3. Despite the fact that potatoes had failed the country was still producing enough food that could have fed its population.

 However, this food was being exported to Britain while the Irish citizens were starving to death. The government pursued economic policies at the expense of human life. This was like sentencing thousands of Irish citizens to death. This was intentional extermination of the Irish citizens and could be termed as genocide committed by the British colonialists. Between 1846 and 1847 there were also evictions in Ireland4. Since the potato had failed the tenants could not pay rent and they were evicted by the land lords.

 The land lords removed several Irish citizens from their native land. Some migrated to developed countries like Britain or were forcefully “exported” to these countries to provide cheap labour. As they travelled some died on the way due to hunger. The poor law extension act required that the land lords to be responsible for their poor tenants. This led the landlords to pay for the emigration of their poorer tenants in order to reduce a burden on their side. This intentional approach of the imperialists to get rid of the Irish natives translates to genocide.

 Another issue is how humanitarian aid was extended to Ireland. In most cases it came from the church and far and unexpected sources. Britain by then was the economic super power of Europe. Moreover, Ireland was its colony. Britain assumed a leissez faire attitude and left the citizens of Ireland to suffer. They extended less aid and this aid decreased as famine progressed5. In fact the blight was seen as a punishment from God to the people of Ireland. This lack of British intervention saw millions emigrate from Ireland to Australia, USA and Britain while other millions of citizens perished.

 The British adopted a policy that disregarded the Irish citizens6. Conclusion Ireland was the first British colony. Between 1845 and 1850 the British government pursued a policy in Ireland that led to starvation, death, emigration and eviction of a substantial part of Irish people7. The policy caused serious physical and mental harm to the people of Ireland. The British government pursued this policy with the intention of substantially reducing the people of Ireland. That is why the census commissioner in 1851 saw Ireland to be better after the famine.

 This planned and intentional strategy by the British authority constitutes an act of genocide towards the citizens of Ireland. Bibliography Boyle, Francis. 2010. The Great Irish Famine Was Genocide.

https://studentshare.org/history/1481569-african-american-history-before,African American History before 1877,"African American History Before 1877 al Affiliation Slavery in America began as early as in the seventeenth century, and the main reason behind this was so that the slaves would help in production of crops grown by the colonies, such as Tobacco. By the late eighteenth century, slavery had become a dominant system in the American society. However, it was during this time that antislavery movements rose, beginning in the North, as they endeavored to abolish slavery in America. Despite the fact that various differences existed between the slavery systems of the North and the South, prior to the eighteenth century, they were heightened by the abolitionist movements.

 However, a number of similarities still existed between slavery systems in the North and the South in the eighteenth century. Majority of the differences rose from the facts that most Northerners were puritans, who loved to work for themselves, and mainly focused on growing food only for their families. Southerners on the other hand were less religious and more focused on attaining economic success, thus mainly grew crops for export. Majority of the similarities rose from the facts that most of the slaves both in the North and South were of African descent, both lived in houses away from their masters, and had similar responsibilities.

 Keywords: Slavery, Slaves, Planters, Masters, North, South, Plantations, Farms, Abolitionists, Eighteenth Century Introduction Slavery in America began in the early seventeenth century, when the earliest slaves from Africa were brought Jamestown, Virginia, which was a colony of North America. The main reason behind this was so that the slaves would help in production of crops grown by the colonies, such as Tobacco. Morgan points out that “during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, three distinct slave systems evolved: a Northern non-plantation system and two Southern plantation systems, one around Chesapeake Bay and the other in the Carolina and Georgia low-country” (1993, p. 81). By the late eighteenth century, slavery had become a dominant system in the American society.

 The demand for more slaves, especially in the south, heightened in the late eighteenth century, as a result of the development of the cotton gin. However, it was during this time that John Locke’s theories of all men being equal and possessing unalienable rights were gain roots, beginning with North America (Schneider, D. & Schneider, C., 2007). It is for this reason that during the eighteenth century, various differences and similarities existed between slavery systems of the North and those of the South in America.

 This paper discusses those differences and similarities. Differences between Slavery Systems of the North and South during the 18th Century in America During the eighteenth century, there were a number of features that differentiated slavery systems in the North and South of America. These include: 1. The difference in the average number of slaves in the North compared to those in the South. In the eighteenth century, slave holdings in the North had about 25 slaves, while in the South slave holdings comprised of approximately 100 slaves (“Facts about Slave Trade and Slavery,” n.d.). 2. The presence of large estates, known as plantations in the South, and conversely smaller farms in the North.

 Due to its size, the South was not a distinct region, but was rather divided into three zones namely the backcountry, Carolina, and Chesapeake, with Chesapeake standing as the largest among the three. Tobacco was a dominant crop grown in vast plantations of the three regions in the south, and this increased the need for slaves to work in the plantations, making the slave system quite solid. Agriculture in the South was mainly for export. In the North on the other hand, farmland was smaller with farming usually taking place on a small scale, and was mainly focused towards providing for the families.

 As a result of this feature, slaves in the North were fewer compared to the south, and the slave system was not as solid. 3. The religious inclination of Northerners, most of whom were puritans, while the Southerners had less attachment to religion. Most Northerners were puritans from England and liked to work for themselves, making the slavery system considerably insignificant, while most Southerners had their focus on economic prosperity, making the slavery system very significant. 4. The rise of the abolitionist movement in the North, while the Southern states rejected it.

 The North began the first emancipation, as they set their slaves free and advocated for abolition of slavery. Vermont, a Northern state was the first to abolish slavery in 1777, while other Northern states followed later (Kubesh, McNeil, & Bellotto, 2007). According to Kubesh, McNeil, and Bellotto, “in the South however, many planters did not want to free their slaves and did not want the state governments to declare slavery illegal” (2007, p. 15). Similarities between Slavery Systems of the North and South during the 18th Century in America 1.

 Slavery was legal in both the North and South in the eighteenth century. Despite the fact that the North began to view slavery as an inhumane practice in the late eighteenth century, slavery had not been made illegal. 2. In both the North and South, most of the slaves in the eighteenth century were of African descent (Foner, 2006). 3. Both the Northern and Southern planters, who consisted of the English, French, and Spanish constructed houses for their slaves away from their homes. Majority of slaves in the eighteenth century lived in small groups, and worked by themselves on farms and plantations far from the homes of their masters (“Facts about Slave Trade and Slavery,” n.d.). 4. In the eighteenth century, the responsibilities held by slaves in the North and the South, were similar.

 This is because they all carried out the duties of working on the lands of their masters. In conclusion, slavery was still a very prominent feature of the American society in the eighteenth century. The practice was still legal in both the North and South of America, despite the fact that majority of the states in the North had begun to abolish it. Substantial differences and similarities existed between Slavery systems of the North and South during the 18th Century in America as discussed in this paper.

https://studentshare.org/sociology/1481616-what-does-it-mean-to-be-american,What does it mean to be American,"What does it mean to be American? The migration of people to the United s has always been a usual phenomenon. The United States is attractive by the spirit of freedom and a lot of opportunities, which seem magical for many foreigners. Notwithstanding that immigrants face many problems in the foreign country, such as problems with finding a job and a place to live as well as racial intolerance, these challenges can’t stop them. Many people come to the United States in order to give their children an opportunity to be born in America and become Americans.

 The question is who Americans are today and if they are just the individuals, who were born in the United States. The contemporary America is not a country of citizens who were born in the United States more than 100 years ago. The majority of American citizens came to the United States not very long ago. According to Lee and Bean, “by the year 2002, the number of foreign-born people living in the United States exceeded 34.2 million, with the size of the U.S.-born second generation about 31.

5 million, so that immigrants and their children accounted for almost 66 million people, or about 23% of the U.S. population” (Lee and Bean, 2012, p.87). The number of immigrants is not going to decrease and foreigners keep moving to the United States searching for better life. Young people come to the USA in order to receive good education and then try to stay in America and build a family there. So, the United States is not only a multinational country, but also a mix of many different cultures, religions, values and principles.

 To be American means to have freedom of word, freedom of choice, many opportunities. There is no other country in the world, where one can have so much freedom. I am sure that it is the spirit of freedom and democracy that connects all the immigrants and makes them American. Certainly, immigrants have their own cultural identity that is determined by their religious beliefs, occupation, types of behavior. The attitude towards race and culture has also changed greatly as Smedley points out: “today scholars are beginning to realize that “race” is nothing more and nothing less than a social invention.

 It has nothing to do with the intrinsic, or potential, qualities of the physically differing populations, but much to do with the allocation of power, privilege, and wealth among them” (Smedley, 2012, p.47). After the realization of truth about race in the American society, Americans became people who were treated equally, no matter what color of skin they have, what culture they belong to and what their sexual orientation is. As America represents the most developed country in the world, the changes in the attitude towards discriminative groups is also changing rapidly in this particular country.

 The most vulnerable question is the relation between sexes. Women are still being abused and face terrible discrimination. It is important to note that even in the United States the changes in relations between sexes and in the attitude towards women started happening not very long ago as Kimmel writes: “a dramatic transformation in thinking about gender . . . has occurred over the past thirty years. In particular, three decades of pioneering work by feminist scholars, both in traditional disciplines and in women’s studies, has made us aware of the centrality of gender in shaping social life” (Kimmel, 2012, p.120). Before the attention was paid mainly to social and racial discrimination, and all the changes that were made, such as providing women with the right to vote, did not change much in reality.

 However, during the last thirty years feminists did much to change the attitude towards women in the society. It is no need to say that feminists mostly succeeded in the American society. Many people criticize the idea of American dream saying that it is just a myth that disappoints foreigners, who come to America in order to improve their standard of living. They may be right to some extent, but the facts show and I think that the United States is really the most developed and democratic state in the world.

 To be American means to be free forever and to be treated equally and respectfully, no matter what country you came from. Certainly, racial, gender and other kinds of discrimination still present in the American society, but people suffer from unequally not so much as in other states. Modern Americans are people who were looking for good and found it in the developed state that provided them with a great number of opportunities. References Kimmel, Michael S.

https://studentshare.org/management/1482809-human-resources-role,Human Resources Role,"Human Resource’s Role First Introduction In the past, traditional HR practices were very popular among organizations. However, with time, the work place as well as the work force has changed radically leading to transformation of traditional human resource management practice from the strict administrator of functions such as recruitment and selection,payroll,compensation and benefits and training to strategic human resource management which considers human resource as a strategic partner contributing to the overall objectives of the organization by taking a rather tactical approach in ensuring that all actions taken are in line with the objectives outlined in the strategic plan.

 In the current economy, HR professionals no longer provide administrative support to staff, instead, they now have to play a more significant and proactive role in the strategic goals as well as objectives of the company. Differences between Traitional Hr role and strategic partnering role The traditional Human Resource role has for ages been administrative headed by persons whose aim is to control cost and general administrative activities. The roles of Human Resource were seen as being transitional such as operational as opposed to strategic, qualitative as opposed to quantitative, policing as opposed to partnering short-term as opposed to long-term and functionally oriented rather than being business oriented in that Human resource managers look at their role as a necessary section of a business that has to be completed while strategic human resource management views their role as a very essential part of the business since employees form the most valuable asset to a company and therefore any decision that they take is made with strategic human resource development in mind (Bhatnagar & Sharma, 2005).

 It is evident that Traditional Human resource and strategic Human resource partnerships differ significantly from each other. Although the two work hand in hand with each other, many companies have shifted from HR to strategic HR for one main reason in that strategic Partnerships model is centered on developing strategic plans that fit perfectly into the larger structure of the organization’s plan where as on the other hand traditional HR is strictly administrative in nature .Human resources managers have traditionally been perceived to be responsible for hiring, recruiting and training new employees while strategic human resources professionals act as strategic partners within the company working alongside top executives and other managements to establish how human resources practices can fit in the strategy plan for the entire company.

 Compared to basic administrative matters, company strategy plays a more essential role in the advancement of human resource policies. Traditional HR is short on focus when it comes to the by and large strategic initiatives of the company but these are prime in strategic human resource management (Lewis, 2013). Another difference between the traditional human resource and the strategic human resource management is on the timing. The traditional human resource is more reactive in that actions are taken only when it is deemed necessary where as strategic human resource is more proactive in that strategic partners do not wait for an issue to arise for them to tackle instead, they already have systems in place to handle any potential issues relating to human resource that might arise even before they occure.

Also the traditional human resources is centered more on an individual employee while the strategic human resource pays close attention on the organization as a whole.Strategic partners are more interested in creating a work environment that is favorable to growth for the organization as opposed to improving an individual’s performance therefore strategic human resource is perceived as the overarching concept that acts as a link between management and deployment of individuals within the company to the business as a whole and its environment (Bhatnagar & Sharma, 2005).

 Conclusion The transformation over the years of Human Resource from administrative role to becoming a strategic business partner continues to evolve. Gone are the days when a HR manager was a person characterized with soft skills. HR is now all about business acumen with all decisions and plans required to be in line with the core business strategy. The focus has now shifted from what a HR does to what a HR is supposed to deliver. As a strategic business partner, the HR must be able to create and add value to the overall strategic objectives of a business by innovating and stepping out of the traditional roles and seeking for opportunities to proactively learn the business they support.

 It is all about having the capacity to create and deliver values matching the organization’s objectives.Therefore the Human resource should be run like a business with clear strategies and clear structures in place to accomplish precise objectives which are alighned to corporate objectives.

https://studentshare.org/business/1482878-write-a-proposal-of-no-more-than,Research Approach for a Strategic Plan,"Research Approach for a Strategic Plan of   Research Approach for Strategic Plan Strategic planning is one of the pillars of a successful business. In fact, successful organizations are reported to have their business operations aligned with their objectives, vision, mission, goals, and thoughts. In essence, strategic planning entails the creation of values, mission and vision statements, an analysis of the competition levels, establishment of legal and ethical standards, creation of a balanced scorecard and tactics for operations, and effective communication machinery.

 However, for an organization to be successful in implementing a strategic plan, these components of strategic plan have to be distinct and separated from one another. It is also of the essence that stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, employees, owners, managers, and even competitors have an idea where the organization is headed with reference to vision, mission, goals, and objectives. Through the development of mission and vision statements, goals, objectives and analyzing competition and competitive edge, an organization attains an upper hand in becoming successful.

 A business should therefore have not only a clear but also a broad mission and vision that reverberate withal stakeholders, including the public and inform the, about the benefits of these vision and mission statements and the entire strategic plans (Olsen, 2012). It is of great necessity that strategic plans and their implementation are thoroughly researched for them to be effectively applied and reformed if need be (Mckeown, 2012). First, the research will be guided by the question of where the organization intends to be in the short-, medium-, and long-term period.

 Second, the research will identify the business’ major goals, the required resources for a successful future, and the target suppliers and customers. Importantly, the strategic plan research will emphasize the organization as a whole rather than a few select departments. Collaboration and collectiveness will also play a rather crucial role in ensuring all stakeholders such as employees, leaders, and customers are involved in the charting of the business’ future. The research will also focus on validating the mission, vision and value statements, which will be based on goals-based planning.

 To gather the required information on researching and developing the right strategic plan, stakeholders such as the Chief Executive Officer, members of the administration, Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and other key stakeholders will be interviewed. These interviews will allow the collection of the right qualitative information and opinions from these stakeholders. The interview questions will target issues that concern the strategic plan, the issues to be resolved immediately and those to be resolved in the future.

 Also to be largely focused on in the interviews are the current vision, values, goals, and mission of the organization and their implementation. The interviews will not be complete without an internal and external environmental analysis. The interviews will thus evaluate the probable effects of external and internal environmental forces and conditions that may impinge on the organization's survival and growth strategies. The external environmental analysis will collect data from studies on the business in relations to the entire industry, competition, politics, and social environment and factors.

 Notably, data will be collected from and about factors such as competitors on which the organization has no direct control. Information will also be collected from the industry’s regulators such as government agencies. Data will also be obtained on the probable opportunities the business may pursue and the likely threats and risks that could jeopardize its drive towards success. Information on the internal and external environment will also be collected from customers and employees. Customer base will thus be a rather vital resource in this strategic plan research.

 Thus, among the external environmental factors that will be explored in the interviewing of external stakeholders include customer bases, shifting demographics, trends and needs, competitive landscape, new technologies, the economic and political environments, and new regulations. The external environment research will thus explore and acknowledge all the stakeholders and factors that are outside of the business’ its control. An analysis of the internal environment will also be carried out.

 Several tools or sources will be accorded keen interest in regard to internal environment analysis. The internal factors affecting the organization will be researched on the basis of these resources and the business’ capabilities. The resources will include profitability, existing overall brand, and relative cost of new products, employee capabilities, product portfolio analysis, sales, and product quality (Allison & Kaye, 2005). With regards to capabilities, the research will identify the business’ weaknesses, strengths, problems, constraints, uncertainties, and risks.

https://studentshare.org/management/1482997-wk4-discussion,Wk4 discussion,"Explain how grouping of activities help to attain program objectives? How do they apply in Public Management? Grouping in a given activityis another name for multiple hands performing a task that would otherwise be performed by lesser strength and ultimately lower output. Introduction: A program is a certain activity that is undertaken to accomplish a certain task. It requires division of tasks, activities and functions. It at the same time requires appointment of more than one personnel since this allows for maximum benefits extraction from the overall scenario.

 Clustering per need and situation: Grouping is another name for easier way of attaining the objectives, easier way of going about the overall program and activity and easier way of handling the resources. Grouping also pertains to dividing the tasks according to the specialty, requirement and demand. Grouping further allows for bringing about synchronization in the overall task at hand. It allows for clear understanding of the objectives at hand. Understanding the objectives and processes and tasks at hand is more important than the practical step.

 The first step to successful execution of the task is to identify what is to be done, how is it to be done, and by whom is it to be done, nearly all of these variable questions pertain to the grouping. Grouping of activities leads to better organization. An essential element that is compensated through it is the reduction of wastes, surplus, overheads and inventory. It further allows for overcoming the defects and faults that otherwise occur in non grouped activities. A step that must precede the grouping is that of definition of objectives.

 Setting the goals forth makes the overall task much easier and viable. Grouping would be of little impact if the objectives are not defined. Group allows for dividing the tasks as per specialty and need. For example a task related to the marketing branch of a given organization would be directly directed to the marketing department, a problem relevant to the technical domain would be directed straight to the technical department, in the same manner the customers related problems would be directed to the customer care and representatives.

 The future planning and policy devising task would be assigned to the top management and hence no hassle. Grouping allows for knowing the individuals skills and expertise, thereby further making it easy to reach the objectives and tasks in due time. Grouping makes the tasks easy by the virtue of dividing the work, segmenting the portions that would otherwise be difficult to attain and overcome (Weltman & Kess 2008, 110). Another advantage served by grouping is that of learning, imparting and knowledge and helping the members who may be fresh to the task or may hold little command and understanding of the tasks assigned.

 Grouping allows for better understanding of the tasks at hand, the problems related, and the potential solutions. Apart from the final outcomes, the inter process stages are made further easier through the grouping of activities and functions (Koontz, 2010). Public Management and Grouping of activities: Public management is a domain and discipline that involves direct dealing with the masses and that too in a large number. Thereby the occurrence of delay in one task or unit could lead to delay of overall process by which the masses and communication is being performed directly with the public.

 Grouping of activities allows for knowing what tasks have been achieved, which particular tasks are in process and the ones that are relatively away from accomplishment and the potential reasons that are impeding the overall process. The task often gets demanding and requires extra cautious approach when public and the clients are directly involved in it. In such situations, the need for grouping becomes ever so vital in order to satisfy the needs of the customers. Since Public management requires dealings and interactions with other franchise, organizations, enterprises and in some cases the governmental units, in such scenario, the grouping allows for better representation and grouping in general allows for a more professional outward expression of the organization and the task at hand, it thereby allows for reduction of the activities which would otherwise consume additional resources in form of manpower, utilities and other material goods.

 It can be safely said that grouping is another name for excluding all the variables, functions and entities that add no value to the overall program, against those functions and variables that are the core to the project and should be undertaken in a due manner (Farmer, 2010).

https://studentshare.org/history/1483047-political-and-military-goals-of-us-policy-towards-afghanistan,Political and military goals of U.S. policy towards Afghanistan,"Module Political and Military Goals of U.S. Policy towards Afghanistan The United s began its political and military operations in Afghanistan in October 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US soil (The National Defense University Library). The US has an imperative national security interest in the present and probable security threats posed by terrorists in Afghanistan. The sole purpose of this mission to ascertain that al-Qaeda training operations are stopped and the overall terrorist scourge is wiped out of Afghanistan (Rozen).

 A critical analysis of the current situation shows that although President Obama’s Afghan policy is somewhat effective, it is serious trouble and measures should be instituted to improve the existing policy. This is because the danger posed by terrorist activity to the United States and their collaborators in Afghanistan is real and without effectual action in the region, there will be continued stability (Rozen). Achieving the political and military goals is of great essence to the overall national security and calls for achievable and realistic objectives.

 First, the US seeks to disrupt terrorist organization in the region thereby hampering their capability to launch global terrorist attacks. Second, the US endorses institution of a capable and accountable government that is functional and serves the people with regards to their security and under minimal international support (Rozen). Third, the US aims to put in place dependent Afghan security forces that can carry out the counterinsurgency fight with minimal US support. The other important goal is to facilitate civilian control and a stable economy that provides opportunity for the citizens.

 Lastly, the US endeavors to involve the international community to help in achieving these goals and objectives in Afghanistan (Rozen). How Likely they are to be Accomplished in the Next Two Years. These are overwhelming objectives need of a new way of thought concerning the challenges, improved relations with the public and a comprehensive diplomatic program. In addition to, they require a considerable change in management, focus of our international aid and improved management of resources (Rozen).

 The diplomatic efforts should be founded on establishing a defined consensus behind the sole goal and supporting objectives. Furthermore, the US must rise above the ‘trust deficit’ it faces in the region where most people believe that it is not a reliable ally. A tactical communication program must be put in place which is more effective and well resourced. This strategy should be promoted by improved civil- military cooperation by the United States agencies, a considerable addition to civilian resources and a new model that dictates the allocation and use of resources.

 The US should ensure that their aid to Afghanistan must be in line with the core goals and objectives. Moreover, additional aid must be followed by concrete systems to ensure improved government accountability. It is important to note that there are currently 90, 000 troops in Afghanistan and this number is to be reduced drastically to 68,000 by late summer (Kaib). By the end 0f 2013 these troops should only be advising Afghan troops and not taking part in any fighting activity. By the end of 2014, the troops should be totally withdrawn from this region (Kaib).

 Despite the fact that the Obama administration is determined to withdraw its troops from the country, it should ascertain that the security put place does not collapse like a house of cards (kaib). Specific Policy Advice to the White House on this Matter. The White House has a duty of coming up with policies that ensure curtailing of al-Qaeda’s operations in Afghanistan, institution of a democratic government and a dependent combat force and maintenance of political and economic growth. The White House is advised to mobilize more global support for their operations in Afghanistan.

 Prioritizing civilian support will foster the relationship between citizens and the government which will enhance development of systems and institutions. It is of great importance to ensure expansion of the Afghan National Security Forces to boost overall security in the country. The White House should ensure that The Afghan government is involved in reinforcing its legitimacy. This is by increasing legality in the election process which boosts the citizens’ faith in government. Finally, there must be an integrated civilian – military counterinsurgency program in Afghanistan.

 This program should incorporate population security with putting in place economic development and efficient local governance. In a nutshell, there are no quick fixes to attain in Afghanistan’s national security by the US. The threat of failure is real and could have dire consequences. It will take the collaborative efforts of the US, its allies and the international community to win the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan. The war against terrorism can be won through better management of resources, expanding the security forces in the country, increasing economic growth and development and ensuring close liaison between the citizens and the government.

 The US is committed towards working with interested parties to overcome the insecurity challenge in Afghanistan. Works Cited Kaib,Marvin. Afghan Policy- Suddenly in Serious Trouble.

https://studentshare.org/philosophy/1483139-defining-marriage,Defining Marriage,"Defining Marriage Same sex marriage has been under heavy scrutiny since the time same sex intimate relationships came into existence. For years people involved in such relationships have fought hard for their rights. Their hard work and commitment to the cause have provided them with favorable results. Certain nations as well as states of certain nations have made same gender marriages legal. Same sex marriages are not only a political, economic or religious issue, it is mainly an ethical issue which can be solved with ethical decision making tool of utilitarianism.

 The law is one avenue that needs to look at issue from the point of ethics and so the decision of whether same sex marriages should be made legal or not should be decided through ethical decision making tool of utilitarianism. The ethical decision making tool of utilitarianism suggests that those actions should be rendered as ethical that result in highest amount of benefits to the overall society and not just certain portions of the society (Mackinnon 37). The tool even suggests that costs and benefits associated with a particular action should be weighed before recognizing a particular action as ethical or unethical.

 In the case of whether same sex marriages should be rendered as ethical or unethical and or legal, the law can take help from the ethical decision making tool of utilitarianism. The laws either have the option of not recognizing same sex marriages as legal or the law can legalize such marriages. If the law continues to regard such marriages as illegal, this decision by law would favor a few and cause disadvantage to the remaining members of the society. If the law regards such marriages as legal, the overall society would benefit while only a few negative effects may be experienced by the society.

 Some of the several benefit that same sex marriages have to offer includes a solution to the problem of children who are unwanted and the burden on the state to take care and provide for such children. Since, couples in similar sex marriages cannot produce children, they will be willing to adopt children and take care of them. Due to this, homeless children will gain better homes and supervision of parents to live under and the state’s burden of taking care of parent less children will decrease.

 A major issue experienced by same gender couples is that they do not enjoy rights that have been provided to opposite sex married couples. If same sex marriages continue to remain illegal, the legal system will be acting in a discriminatory manner where individuals of different sex couples will enjoy benefits and individuals from same sex couples will have to experience hardships. Same sex couples are not allowed to make decisions for their soul mates and they are not allowed to visit them in healthcare settings and due to this they experience a lot of emotional issues.

 Legalization of such marriages will provide both same sex and opposite sex couples with equal rights and benefits. Marriages are a personal matter where couples have the right to decide who to marry and whom not to marry. Same sex marriages are even similar to opposite sex marriages as these marriages are an outcome of love and affection two individuals have for each other. Same sex marriages are not causing any harm to the society or any other constituencies, these marriages are opposed by religious identities without any reason.

 Religious identities should focus on other matters that are ruining the society, instead of focusing on a issue that is not causing any damage to the society. One of the weaknesses associated with utilizing this theory for deciding whether same sex marriage should be legalized or not is that application of this theory means that the motive due to which such marriages are being protested in favor of is not taken into consideration under utilitarianism. There may be several reasons that are unknown and due to these reasons same sex couples are protesting to legalize these marriages.

 These reasons may include methods of gaining tax relief from the government or manipulating the government’s policy of immigration. Another issue is the 100% of the society cannot be benefited from a particular decisions, even if a decision is benefiting 75% of the society, the remaining 25% are being negatively impacted by a decision that is regarded as ethical under the theory of utilitarianism. I completely agree with the decision of legalizing same sex marriages as I believe that this decision will only benefit the society.

https://studentshare.org/biology/1475151-membrane-budding-in-cells,Membrane Budding in Cells,"Membrane Budding in Cells Membrane budding in cells Budding is an asexual reproduction, in which new off springs form from the buds of organism. The buds grow by means of cell division. The newly formed organisms stick to their parents until the moment when they mature. Membrane budding is also vesicle budding or vesicle formation. The process involves evagination of a membrane to form a vesicle. Vesicles are minute membrane enclosed sacs, which are responsible for transportation of cargo inside a cell.

 Vesicle budding is responsible for membrane activities such as vesicular transport and virus release. In vesicle transport, through membrane-bounded vesicle, substances move to the newly forming vesicle. All these occur during the process of budding, when they move the substances through the cell (Hurley, Boura, Carlson and Rozycki, 2010). Eukaryotic cells consist of organelles and cytoskeletons. Cytoskeletons are cellular structures in the form of a skeleton that determine the shape of a cell.

 Organelles refer to specialized internal structures of a cell that carry out an action. The nucleus in the cell’s surrounding, is a double membrane with pores, which facilitates movement of materials in and out of the cell. Eukaryotic cells undergo the process of mitosis where they split into two daughter cells (Bryne & Roberts, 2009). The eukaryotic cells have a structure that separates its internal organelles, in the cytoplasm. The molecules production occurs inside one organelle of a cell, but eventually released outside the cell.

 In the cells, vesicular transport accomplishes communication within the cell, between the internal compartments. In the beginning of the process, sorting begins with lipids and proteins. After which, the molecules include them into the waiting transport carriers. In a eukaryotic cell, budding occurs in several events. The donor membrane initiates budding of a membrane vesicle. The waiting transport carriers, transports it for fusion, with the compatible acceptor membrane. It is through the process of membrane budding that virus escapes from their host cells and infect others (Bryne & Roberts, 2009).

 Coated vesicle budding refers to the process of evaginizing the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to form a COPII-coated vesicle. There are two types of coated vesicle budding these are clathrin and, COP II and I. The mechanisms in clathrin involve the coating of the vesicles with clathrin to form membrane free baskets like structure. In fact, the clathrin solely relies on the adaptors for its functioning. This is because clathrin is unable to bind with both the cargo and the membrane. The adaptor protein complex, AP-2, works at the plasma of mediated-clathrin endocytosis (Hurley, Boura, Carlson and Rozycki, 2010).

 As a result, the protein complex, forms different types of lattices that adapt to different cargoes (Wenk & Paolo, 2012). This is a fact provided by the flexible nature of its monomers. Though clathrin, cargo adaptors and Pl (4, 5) P2 are essential in membrane curving, they cannot do this on their own. The endocytic factor in clathrin enables it to attain a positive curvature. The COP II complex coats the vesicles in COP II and I. The coated vesicles that take the shape of a basket have no membrane (Hurley, Boura, Carlson and Rozycki, 2010).

 During the process, COP I- coated vesicles facilitate transportation from the Golgi to the ER. The COP II monomers are flexible thus; the lattices formed are expandable and can increase, therefore, in size, to hold a large capacity of cargoes. Unlike clathrin, there is no use of adaptors instead; it uses a membrane, which consists of synthetic unsaturated phospholipids in the budding process. COP II and I are purely protein-directed membrane budding (Hurley, Boura, Carlson and Rozycki, 2010).

 In the formation of viruses, membrane budding is important. A number of the viruses seek the help of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery in the host cell. This machinery consists of a cytosomic protein, which includes ESCRT-0, ESCRT-II, ESCRT-III, and I. These proteins, in addition to other proteins, in the cell help to allow membrane budding away from the cytoplasm (Hurley, Boura, Carlson and Rozycki, 2010). This is because ESCRT machinery drives away from the cytosol, preventing it self from any consumption by the bud.

 The major functions of the ECSRT machinery, are in multivesicular body biogenesis, viral budding, and cellular abscission. Multivesicular body biogenesis refers to the process in which, proteins rich in ubiquitin, enter the endosomes, through the formation of vesicles. During this process, cells destroy the damaged proteins, thus preventing protein build up, which causes neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, Cellular abscission refers to the processing of cleaving a membrane that connects two daughter cells.

 Without cleaving the membrane, budding could result in the generation of abnormal cells that contain twice amount of DNA in them. In viral budding, the ESCRT machinery assists in the release of viruses from the cells (Wenk & Paolo, 2012). ESCRT-recruiting motifs, the late domains, have a function of enabling release and assembly of virus at the late stage. The late domain presence is in viruses such as the HIV-1 (Hurley, Boura, Carlson and Rozycki, 2010). In the absence of proteins, lipids phase separation drives budding in membranes of synthetic models on a micron scale.

 They enable the membrane bilayers to exist as a liquid or solid phase, depending on the temperature and the composition. Mostly, the bilayers exist as liquid phases, which divided into liquid disordered and liquid ordered phases, which can exist in mixed composition membranes. Lipids in budding sites of HIV-1 are important in forming and release of HIV-1 particles (Hurley, Boura, Carlson and Rozycki, 2010). The protein-lipid interactions help the HIV-1 in targeting its assembly in the plasma membrane for it to fuse with it, leading to release of virion.

 In clathrin-coated vesicle budding, the lipid PI (4, 5) P2 aids in recruiting AP-2 adaptor in the budding site. In COP II, lipids bond with the cargo to form outer cage and support budding. Despite the ability of HIV-1 to form buds, it needs the help of ESCRT, to release the buds from the host. That is HIV-1 virus is dependent on ESCRT, and interference in the ESCRT reduces the release of the HIV-1 virus (Bryne & Roberts, 2009). In conclusion, membrane budding is majorly a protein and lipid-based process.

 This process is important for viral reproduction. Apart from reproduction, the process is essential in transportation within the cell. Through further research in membrane budding, it will help find an amicable solution in the stopping of dangerous human pathogens such as HIV and influenza. References Byrne, H. J., Roberts, L. J.

https://studentshare.org/sociology/1475231-hidden-victims,Hidden Victims,"“Hidden Victims” by Susan Sharp Questions One of the cases that readers come across while reading Sharp’s “Hidden Victims” is the Gregg v. Georgia case. The other case is the Locket v. Ohio case. The two cases provide excellent examples of what active participation is all about in the system. Gregg v. Georgia case was designed with the aim of distinguishing it from all the other criminal cases. According to Sharp, the case was set to make the case more qualified for a death sentence (5).

 Susan Sharp is quick to point out that the Gregg v Georgia case decisions have over the years been abused and seems to be administered in the most unfair way, targeting the non-white people, the poor and applying only to when the victims are white (6). In the Locket v. Ohio case there is presentation of evidence that is mitigated and the form Gregg decisions which were applied, are no longer used. The Locket v. Ohio case has now shifted the decision as to whether a death sentence should be applied or not.

 The latter case now proves that passing a death sentence today is more of a merciful process, where the offender’s actions are weighed against the claims made by families of the victims. In both of these cases, it is clear that the families or the victim and the offender participate. In the social process theories, the assumption is that every individual has the capability of violating law. Therefore, theories such as these from social scientists and experts are some of the reasons that allow people to believe that some prisoners have been wrongfully convicted.

 According to Sharp, it is not only fuelled by theories, but also stories, public opinion, racial bias and financial costs incurred (115). The author also points out that latest technology, such as DNA testing is proof enough that people in the past were convicted wrongfully (Sharp 120). Knowing that the prisons are mixed with both the guilty and the innocent, people only accept this collectively, when provided with the DNA evidence. In addition to this, most people believe that the innocent are likely to accept a plea bargain when they are offered and plead innocent until proven otherwise.

 The sociological perspective from which Sharp draws her conclusions, points out that people often forget that the same murderers that are sentenced to death are brothers, sisters, fathers or mothers to innocent families. The fact that there are innocent people who are locked up in prisons is prove to show that people outside the prisons are also not so safe from the system that makes a lot of mistakes. The stories and theories given by families of inmates that were convicted years ago is also another way that has led people to believe both the innocent and guilty can be found in prisons. Prof. Sharp’s interview with the affected families and the convicted inmates correlates with the discussions on cognitive dissonance because it reflects on the emotions of people affected.

 Cognitive dissonance occurs mostly in situations where the person’s actions are in conflict with the beliefs that are there in the society or the individual’s beliefs. The cognitive dissonance that seems to affect individuals such as the ones depicted in the interview can be noted, in the responses that they give to the interviewer. Most of the convicted value their freedom but most are in prison whether guilty or innocent (Sharp 190). Most of the offenders or the affected families are aware of such conflicting beliefs that exist in the society, but embrace these beliefs because this is how they are able to improve their ability to make decisions.

 Opposing death penalty in a case that is pending is as explained by the author unacceptable. Groups of people who are opposing the penalties are also not allowed to be among the jury. Applying the social processes theory, this can be explained with the assumption that in social process theories, crime is also dependent on cultural values and norms. Hence, everyone is made aware that the same criminals that these groups defend are as a result of the society’s norms. The social processes that create this condition include the assumptions that there are no individual differences and that antisocial behavior among most of the offenders is usually learned and not a natural occurrence.

 This seems to be an acceptable policy in sentencing, because the jury has to be an independent body that is not under the influence from the offender’s family or the victim’s family. In conclusion, it is evident that for the families of the hidden victims, who are the offenders, the community in most cases seems to blame them for having raised such a person. The families of the victims, the people affected are often classified as part of the prosecution and the society is usually merciful towards them.

 For example, in the cases Sharp gives in the book, she provides readers with the idea that both sides have a sigh of relief because judgment is administered in a fair way. The Americans as depicted in the case are the families of the accused and the victims. However, the author is quick to point out that both sides face grief, trauma and financial losses (Sharp 9).

https://studentshare.org/culture/1482416-culture-essay,Hispanic Culture Description,"Hispanic Culture Culture is a learned, shared and symbolic system of beliefs, values and attitudes that influences and shapes behavior and perception. In other words culture is intangible which is formed through refinement over human behavior over a period of time that resides in the learned behavior (A Baseline Definition of Culture, n.d.). It can be considered as a “mental code” or “mental blueprint” for living and thinking that are programmed in the heads of the society’s member. Hence Culture is “in the mind”.

 We cannot measure, weigh or photograph culture. By studying things like all kinds of behavior, rituals and customs, material culture, social structure, language, we can indirectly study culture (Dahl, n.d.). As per Meadows if 1000 people consisted of a village 52 would accounted for North Americans, 84 Latin Americans, 95 from east and Western Europe and the others from the part of the world (Meadows, n.d.). Being originated from the Hispanic culture, I would like to make a brief study about my Hispanic culture.

 The understanding and appreciation of important concepts of the Hispanic culture by the educators of Hispanic adolescents or children is necessary (His/Her Name is Today, n.d.). Any person of Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, central or South American or other Spanish origin or culture can be us that is Hispanics, regardless of race. The term Hispanic, as we have been referred, dated back to 1970s when people were asked to self-identify as Puerto Rican, Mexican, Cuban, South/central American or other Hispanics by Census.

 The National Survey has found mixed reaction in our population about identifying ourselves separately as Hispanic. 10.5 million Hispanic children are there aged under 18. It has been found that we are the fastest growing youth population and there will be more than one in five children of Hispanic origin (CDC’s Healthy Community Program, pp. 1-2). Cultural insights portray the influence of behavior over a specific culture made through effective and efficient communication. It has been observed that we the Hispanics had originated from a collectivistic culture.

 Going back to roots of our culture I find that in our culture, answerability was collective and accountability was allocated within the group. Our ancestral people gave profound importance towards the synchronization, accord, collectivity and collaboration among themselves. They focused more on team play rather than individual activities. We the Hispanic people were characterized by a long live. Our ancestors were usually found to have a lower income than the White Americans. To them getting infected with disease is of greater concern rather than death.

 It has been said’ “For the Hispanic community, issues of morbidity rather than mortality are of greatest concern, which include lifestyle and behaviors affecting health; environmental factors such as exposure to pesticides, unclean air and polluted water; and the ongoing need for more effective use of existing health services” (CDC’s Healthy Community Program, n.d., pp. 1-2). The Church and religion lead a profound influence in our culture in medieval times. This leads to an impact on the cultural believe of the society.

 Our ancestral cultural believe was concerned about health, disease and medicines. Our believe regarding health issues in turn made widespread utilization of church based religious faith on material culture. It has been observed that in the our culture consisting of Mexican American, Cuban American, Puerto Rican people endowed with different instances of assimilation and alteration of original customs and issues related to health. These modifications were based on the beliefs of our culture as a whole.

 Catholic priests were considered as the authority for curing special diseases. They were considered as the patron representing certain community. Non Christian divinities were also considered as the healer and savior who would rescue them from any health related ailments. Our medicinal practices were thus demarcated from the annotation of Christianity. On the other hand people belonging to Spain forming a part of our culture took medicines as the savior of health and life. We exerted more importance over medicines and their religious outlook had lesser importance over their materialistic believes.

 But it does not indicate that we, originated from Spain, ignored the religious belief prevailing in their society. Our health system was indicated a mix of believes over medicinal science and faith on religion and culture. In contrast, people who held their roots in Africa, Europe and other countries forming a part of the Hispanic culture followed a different health care system. We made our health care system‘s foundation on the basis of religious relics of our ancestors. Though different from each other in terms of methodologies of health care system, the three cultures followed the same principle of healing which was in connotation with faith related to supernatural invention in terms of health, ailments and recovery.

 The effects of the three different practices were different in nature as they all differed in pretext of historical condition and experiences (Kanellos, Veaver, Fabregrat, 1994, pp.60-70). We all looked upon good health as a reward of God as a mean of better existence of good life. We wore religious medals which were considered as a guard from aliments. Illness in our ancestral society was considered as a curse by God. We categorized ailment food and water as hot and cold in contrast. If somebody was ill food and water consumption was considered as treatment in opposite direction.

 Inspite of being a person belonging to Hispanic culture, I do not support the traditional health care system. In various parts around the globe people of Hispanic people are still stuck with old believes regarding ailments. People in modern times from our culture should know the demarcation between religion and ailment and take help of modern medicines.

https://studentshare.org/sociology/1482558-solutions-to-illegal-immigration-in-america,Solutions to illegal immigration in America,"Introduction Illegal immigration is no longer an unfamiliar topic among most Americans. Illegal immigration has both negative and positive impacts of the US economy. The current level of illegal immigration to America has enlarged the discussions about immigration leading to an undesired influence. Illegal immigrants are separated into disparate areas and hard to be distinguished. The government has tried various ways to prevent illegal immigration, including reinforcing border lines and administrating the existing illegal immigrants (Skerry 1).

 American government is expected to deal with the illegal immigration in America in aspects of economic, social and political issues. Employers enjoy higher income because the cost of labor reduces drastically (Haugen and Musser 31). A growing number of Americans feel that national wealth is going into wrong hands. There is a need to ensure that public goods are used by those who pay for them (Shipler 41). This calls for an immigration policy that leads to fiscal sustainability and economic progress.

 Illegal immigration is likely to end up derailing economic recovery through an increased number of unaccounted activities and tax avoidance. 2. Economic implications The economic cost of illegal immigration is enormous (Lecker, Chiswick, and Rapoport 19). Illegal immigrants are known to avoid payroll taxes or taxes that arise from documented work. Allowing illegal immigrants to have full access to public resources that are non-excludable creates inequalities (Eldredge and Riggenbach 23). Some of these national resources include national defense, public roads and schools (Skerry 1).

 The ability of the federal or state governments to enforce laws that deny illegal immigrants access to the public resources has been difficult. The move is also considered unpopular. The government has been urging illegal immigrants to come out of hiding. Immigration is known to account for the rise in school enrollment and is contributing to the need for a health insurance (Lecker, Chiswick, and Rapoport 19). Fiscal sustainability is being advocated as a form of American identity. Americans are encouraged to be proud of engaging in lawful and authentic deals as part of the national values.

 The process of assimilating illegal immigrants is known to be contentious (Lecker, Chiswick, and Rapoport 19). 3. Social aspects and deliberations Illegal immigration has resulted into significant social issues. The Native Americans feel threatened by the ability of immigrants to raise incomes and to perform exceptionally in education systems (Eldredge and Riggenbach 23). An increased assimilation rate means social inclusion and increased human capital (Marquardt 19). This can cause the Native Americans to be rendered irrelevant in multiple aspects.

 Notwithstanding the concerns, assimilation is viewed as a solution is the proposed policy to control illegal immigration (Lecker, Chiswick, and Rapoport 19). This means that the federal government would have to weigh the economic and social impact of viewing illegal immigrants inclusively. The move would ensure that the government brings the immigrants to full taxation and lead to a demand of public goods (Eldredge and Riggenbach 23). The program would lead to fiscal sustainability. This can happen through launching and developing a domestic workers program through which workers visas can be given to the undocumented workers.

 The federal government can use this program to target specific areas of labor shortages without having to affect the social standing of the Native Americans (Haugen and Musser 31). This would call for a well-calculated incentives ratio (Lecker, Chiswick, and Rapoport 19). A telling example would be a law that ensures that for every 60 Native Americans hired, 40 registered immigrants are considered. The program is criticized by those who argue that the program would be centered on enhancing opportunities for illegal immigrants. 4. Illegal immigrations and political issues The political effects of illegal immigration can only be addressed through a holistic view of the issue (Eldredge and Riggenbach 23).

 This includes relooking surging number of illegal immigrants has reached a level of crisis considering the status quo is unacceptable (Lecker, Chiswick, and Rapoport 20). Dealing with the challenge of illegal immigration aims at ensuring there is no disproportionate allocation of resources (Haugen and Musser 31). The federal government aims at ensuring economic prosperity for all social groups (Marquardt 17; Lecker, Chiswick, and Rapoport 19). This prevents creation of an underclass within the citizenry.

 This has been occasioned by a realization that a section of the society is responsible to paying the price of the unrecognized citizens. The policy of economic and social equity and prosperity is expected to ensure that illegal immigrants compete legally in the market (Marquardt 17). It also ensures they do not become an underclass (Lecker, Chiswick, and Rapoport 19). This proposals aims at encouraging illegal immigrants have access to subsidies for investment, credit and insurance which are vital in social mobility. 5. Conclusion The cost of illegal immigration has caused the policy makers to consider the need to opening address the national issue.

 The congress is considering charging the immigrants an entry fee or targeting their employers with taxes (Haugen and Musser 31). This would compel them to be legalized. The process of enforcing the existing rules against illegal immigration has been expensive. Focusing on the border is perceived to be easy and inconclusive (Shipler 41). The impact of the immigrants of the public finances and social welfare has been felt by the Native Americans. A constructive immigration policy must ensure that low-skilled immigration generates productivity in the US economy.

 This is expected to limit fiscal cost of illegal immigration through containing enforcement expenses. Works Cited Eldredge, Dirk, and Jeff Riggenbach.

https://studentshare.org/nursing/1482579-personal-nursing-philosophy,Personal Nursing Philosophy,"Personal Nursing Philosophy Personal Nursing Philosophy My personal philosophy relates to short-term goals that I should achieve in order to ensure that the patient has received quality health care services. One of these goals is for the patient to stop suffering from pains and any form of distress. The other goal is to make the patient learn to live in a way that will facilitate his recovery, while the next goal is to facilitate increase of tolerance of patients to their daily activity. There are also some long-term goals that the nurses are focused on achieving in terms of treating the patient.

 On the other hand, the long-term goals entail the creation of an optimal degree of harmony and balanced between his external and internal environment. This paper focuses on discussing my personal philosophy about nursing, health, environment, nursing practice, education, administration, and research. In regard to my personal philosophy about environment, I consider it to be a perceptual field that surrounds each person. For instance, Neumann (2002) expressed her idea regarding environment based on the stress factors and the reaction towards each condition that bring about stress in nursing practice.

 She also introduced a belief that stress factors comprise the environment and further argued that the disequilibrium in the body system that is caused the stress as a tension. In fact, this tension act as the stimuli, which has the potential of causing the illness to the individual that, is suffering from the stress. According to my philosophy about health, there is a relationship between the utilization health care services and the numerous visits and application of various technologies in health care systems, such as imaging and diagnostic technologies.

 Moreover, these services have proofed to be beneficial to numerous patients, despite insignificant guidance offered by various sources in the medical field. Therefore, there is a need to deal with the disparities identified in the treatment of parties associated with life expectancy, whereby there should be a spending measure for the end of life patients, which is attributable to the numerous modes of treatment. Therefore, in my opinion environment is subdivided into two components that include the internal and external factor.

 Internal factors entails influences associated with individuals’ or intrapersonal stress factor, while external environment entails interpersonal stress factors that emanate from relations with other people. This is in terms of changes in the roles that can bring about stress to an individual. On the other hand, my philosophy regarding nursing is that it offers identified models, which are considered to be guidelines for different levels of nursing education. The model facilitates management and incorporation of significant variables, which enables nurses to assist patients improve in their conditions.

 The model focuses on facilitating ways patients can be encouraged to be involved in a good lifestyle. Furthermore, nursing education enables practitioners to remain up-to-date with necessary information, which enables them deal with changes in the field of health care services. My philosophy about nursing practice is that nurses are bound to prevent invasion of stressors by providing the resources that strengthen the patients system and coping with positive functioning. This is though motivating the patient and using stress as a positive intervention strategy.

 Therefore, nurses engage in mobilizing the patient’s internal and external resources focusing on the achieving stability. Besides, they can also seek to maintain the stability through educating and reorienting the patient’s system as required. My philosophy of nursing administration focuses on emphasis concerning the need for effectiveness in the field of clients care, health care reforms, health promotion, and policy development. There is imperativeness in the development of emergent nurse leaders at this time in history.

 The involvement of this leadership comprises of the numerous definition, delivery mechanism, activities, definition, and framework competence. Several institutions have been offering leadership education to nurses. They are focused at ensuring that they have offered required information that can assist them to develop their management and administrative skills. These skills facilitate the establishment of effective functionality of the nursing field. My philosophy about nursing research relates to its great contribution to the field of nursing since it provides reliable information to those who are aspiring to offer reliable health care services.

 Nursing research facilitates developing of careers of various medical practitioners through provision of the knowledge that can assist them to deliver their services to the patients. Therefore, in my opinion, nursing research offers relevant information in the field of nursing to facilitate gathering of ample ideas that can assist in carrier development, and finding treatment for new diseases.

https://studentshare.org/nursing/1482611-nutritional-practices,Nutritional Practices,"Nutritional Practices Nutritional practices and behaviors collectively depend on culture, age, education, economic and social condition, health status, household structure and of course access to food. On the basis of such segregated behaviors in the community, the different subgroups, divided on the basis of ethnicity, age, race, income groups etc possibly will respond differently. Describing and analyzing the nutritional practices of the following ethnic groups living in the U.S, is relatively easy however, at the same time, it is difficult to characterize their net effect to account for the health benefits and disease reduction as each of the ethnic group observes diverse eating practices.

 Analyzing the nutritional practices can however identify useful insights to the governments of maintaining health and reducing the disease risks (Health.mo.gov). As more and more ethnic groups have come into existence in the United States, more trends to nutrition are prevailing among these culture groups including diverse eating habits and food practices. These diverse eating lifestyles are not innate rather they are formed and learned through different societies’ setups. However the essence of individual ethnic culture is still reflected in the mainstream of food culture hence, enriching the American diet with various cuisines from diverse cultures.

 United States inhabits few of the most popular ethnic groups including African-American, Asian-Indian, Mexican-American, among the others. The diet of African-American group consists of items that largely derive from the ancestral generations. Their food fare is known as Soul Food that contains dietary customs and food practices that largely depend on the socio economic levels of income and status. The staple of soul food consists of “greens” which collectively includes green leafy-vegetables, dandelion greens, pokeweed spinach and kale etc whereas their mainstay food item is corn.

 Grains are also considered as basic in their nutritional plan such as grits, rice, muffins, cooked macaroni and biscuits etc. They also take “sweet milk” as whole milk as well as butter milk. Variety of meat items compensate for their protein diet including beef, pork meat, fish, poultry that are either fried or breaded. Though, short cooking time restricts them to go for frying meat. Another ethnic group in the U.S is actually of the immigrants from different Asian lands giving rise to Asian-Indian ethnicity.

 This ethnic group is quite diverse because of its composition by various cultures such as Islam, Jainism, Buddhism, Christianity and Sikhism etc. As a result if different religions, they frequently observe their respective dietary laws as permissible by their religions. They frequently access to food that is non alcoholic and prefer rice, chapatti and food items made of grounded wheat and flour grains (Riskfactor.Cancer.gov). They also eat protein diet to fill in their nutritional practices including meat, fish, and poultry.

 They also take chips and curried vegetables. Residents spending a longer time also start including alcoholic beverages in their diet. However, their diet is changed to foods containing high levels of saturated-fat from high fiber low fat foods. The Prima Indians forms another ethnic group who mainly focused their nutritional diet on food items that fuel obesity causing diabetes. Mexican-American life gives enough priority to Food, including it as a big part of their life. Their traditional diet is composed of low fat and high fiber food items.

 Their diet includes beans, rice, corns, tortillas etc. however their eating habits have resulted in diabetes type 2. Eating healthier foods and returning to conventional eating practices may possibly benefit them (Kulkarni). Each of the three ethnic groups has varying priorities to nutritional practices depending on the cultures they reflect. However, a balanced nutritional diet is significant to satisfying the psychological needs of every one. The food nurtures the human body as well as to satisfy the biological urge of hunger so that the human body can withstand the illnesses and continue a healthier longer life.

 Satisfying hunger has been a common aim for the nations however which is deeply prioritized in the U.S. as part of the necessary and essential policies manifested for the U.S citizens and health care services. Any decision regarding the nutritional practices followed and pursued by each of the ethnic groups, largely depend on the cultures and inherited policies each of them are following. However, instances from their traditional practices and ethnic backgrounds also help in deciding for the food and eating habits retained by them (Mightystudents.com).

https://studentshare.org/literature/1482612-cultural-analysis-of-susan-glaspellyies-yptriflesy,Cultural Analysis of Susan Glaspell's Trifles and Edith Wharton's Roman Fever,"Resistance Literature: The Feminine Voice Introduction The literary project was faced with the mission of expressing or giving voice to a huge range of individuals with whom literature has little in common as regards cultural framework and values. Authors, like Susan Glaspell and Edith Wharton, did not back away from the task at hand. Certain as they were of the capacity of literature to represent their marginalized status in society and its apparently boundless ethical objectivity, they placed emphasis on the most excellent techniques to give voice to the marginalized—the oppressed, the demoralized, and the excluded.

 Using Susan Glaspell’s Trifles and Edith Wharton’s Roman Fever, this essay shows how literature by such traditionally ‘marginalized’ figures can highlight their status as outsider or ‘other’ in society in such a way that reaches out to encourage awareness and understanding in its mainstream members. From the literary perspective, Glaspell, Wharton, and other feminist advocates have enlightened readers how domestic thoughts expressed itself as a way of bringing about political and social change from the private domain.

 In 1916, reintroducing the major components that composed domestic narrative, Glaspell demonstrates in Trifles how in times of political disorder and cultural chaos the American home turns out to be a frightening context for the so-called strength of patriarchal supremacy and how the division between the public and private sphere is but an imagined concept. Trifles is all about the perfect domestic woman, which is embodied by Minnie Wright, whom Glaspell regards as the discursive consequence of patriarchy.

 One of the major issues the narrative raises is if the domestic philosophy and its associated gender oppression make females truly defenseless, marginalized, and incapable. One of the foundational components of experience that have set women apart from men has been their allocation to the domestic arena. In the domestic arena women have confronted personal susceptibility to external forces, cultivating a feeling of being tied to outside conditions, of not having control over one’s own life, of feeling bound to overarching forces that affect their endeavors.

 Still, in Trifles, Glaspell shows that in this domestic arena women were also capable of building their own space and to maintain their own cultural spheres, as demonstrated by Minnie Wright and accepted by Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale (Glaspell 36): I guess you know about how much he talked himself, but I thought maybe if I went to the house and talked about it before his wife, though I said to Harry that I didn’t know as what his wife wanted made much difference to John. Indeed, the felony of Minnie Wright represents a radical transformation of the domestic sphere.

 In essence, Trifles reveals the power of women to change their destiny, to resist oppression, and disprove stereotypes. Likewise, Edith Wharton demonstrates in Roman Fever both the marginalization of women and their power to improve their status in society. This marginalization stems from the competition between two women for the love of one man. But feminine power is also demonstrated through this competition. Competitiveness is not only inherent in the world of men; it can also manifest in the world of women, as proven by Mrs.

 Ansley and Mrs. Slade. Moreover, in this narrative, Wharton poses issues about the influences of past experiences on present circumstances. She explores how women build their identities through their understanding of the past and the value of their decisions and actions (Wharton 22). Mrs. Ansley and Mrs. Slade have hidden some things that have furnished them a sense of power over time, affecting how each has acted in response to her situation. Through their connection with each other, Wharton discusses the vicious attributes of female competition and the subtle acts that women carry out to attain their goals.

 She also discusses how mothers determine their daughters’ future, a theme that reveals the inherent power of women—motherhood. Glaspell’s Trifles and Wharton’s Roman Fever represented one of the most marginalized sector in society—women. They vividly portrayed how women are oppressed and subjugated by the patriarchal society; how women are relegated in the fringes of humanity. But both these writers also showed the power of women to change their fate, to break down the barriers that keep them inferior.

 And through literature, women can assert this muted power. Works Cited Glaspell, Susan. Plays by Susan Glaspell. UK: Cambridge University Press, 1987. Print. Wharton, Edith. Roman Fever and Other Stories. New York: Scribner, 1997. Print.",Literature,Essay,College
https://studentshare.org/psychology/1481892-operant-conditioning-and-superstitions,Operant Conditioning and Superstitions,"The Operant Conditioning The operant conditioning is a psychological theory invented by Thorndike while he researched to understand the intelligencequotient of animals. In this experiment Thorndike studied the external situation and the response of mouse when locked in a puzzle box. He was studying the process of transformation of the conscious mind to the science of behavior. The instrumental learning of Thordike is termed as “operant conditioning” where the individuals accustomed with new responses in align with that “operate on” the environment.

 Operant conditioning is a theory which suggested the effect of punishment on the stimuli response of an individual. It also states that the response stop as the reinforcement stops. The operational conditioning was on rise because it allowed the psychological world to study the cognitive processing of animals and humans. According to (Labrador,2004,pg.178-187)“ Quickly,operant conditioning application began to increase and a trend developed into what we called BM”The factors for its rise is due to its ability in performing control and behavior modification, treating individuals ,studying individual’s response in social and non-social environment, concentrate on consequences of behavior and so on.

 As per (Goldman,2012)“The tools used in operant conditioning are known as positive and negative reinforcement and positive and negative punishment”. It is a known fact that the operant conditioning gives way to superstition behavior in people. It is the principle of operant conditioning which associates action with consequences that lead to development of superstition and the process of maintaining it. Superstitions are part of many people’s life and there are different types of superstitions which individual nurture in order to get gain or happiness to oneself.

 One of the superstitions is the wearing of lucky charm while gambling in order to win. Here looking from operant conditioning theory, the gambler is working on positive reinforcement by utilizing variable ratio schedule of reinforcement. According to (Krigman, 2004) “The most powerful feature of the slots for encouraging desired behavior, Professor Creed believes, is the reinforcement function”. The operant conditioning theory believes that superstitions are caused when an individual connect his actions with consequences.

 When certain action reinforce positive or negative outcome, then a person avoid or perform the particular action to reduce loss or reap benefit. The mind is conditioned to believe that certain operations rule the consequences of certain actions which are deemed as superstition. When a random set of actions are rewarded, people tend to reinforce actions to get same outcome from the same action. So as the operant conditioning mentions, the individual reinforce the action to get the repeated consequences .

If an action gives negative result then the person will avoid that action in order to stop loss. So the principle of operant conditioning reveals why the superstitious beliefs get long ingrained in the minds of the people. Operational conditioning is a psychological process where in an individual associates his action with consequences which can be bad or good. If a person experience that certain action can bring bad consequences then he avoid it and when it gives good results he reinforce it.

 The person looks at the result and performs the action repeatedly to gain or avoid loss. A superstition is arisen when a person is rewarded or punished for a random set of actions. The way to stop superstition is to continue behaving superstitiously without getting reward or punishment until the association of the action with result is extinguished. As per(Vyse,1997,pg.3)“Our understanding of the natural world tells us that these signs and gestures cannot possibly affect the events at which they are directed, yet superstition is extremely common, if not universal”.

 Thinking about superstition, I recall one of my friends had this unusual way of wearing a silver chain with cross on his exam days in order to win a high score. He states that twice he wore this chain and he got score beyond 70 percentages. Here we can associate this instance with the operant conditioning behavior, where the friend is wearing the silver chain for the third time to get good scores in exam. The action is being reinforced in order to have a positive consequence. This repetition of the behavior take the form of superstition wherein he blindly believes that wearing chain can increase his score despite of his hard work.

 As per (Spencer, 2000)“Superstition is also associated with more impractical and random occurrences. For instance, a person might see a black cat and minutes later they find they have lost their purse or wallet”. Bibliography Goldman, J. G. (2012, December 13). What is operant conditioning?.

https://studentshare.org/nursing/1481982-patient-care-and-influence-on-my-career,Patient Care and Influence on the Career,"My patient care duties as an LPN contributed greatly to my decision to apply for further education in your nursing school. I used to work under the directions of Registered nurses and physicians in delivering patient care in the hospital. I made a huge contribution to bathing patients and assisting patients during their physical therapy sessions. I also provided basic bedside care services such as taking vital patient disease signs such as blood pressure levels, pulse rate, and body temperature.

 My patient care in assisting the patients relieve pain and discomfort through applying new dressings, applying ice packs and providing alcohol rubs enabled me to acknowledge the valuable work that nurses do in delivering high-quality patient care. I appreciate the dignity of human life and need to handle all patients with respect and that is why I participated in feeding the patients, recording the fluid intakes, and assisting patients with their personal hygiene (Chang 12).
I believe that my approach to patient care was holistic since I carried out an ongoing physical, social and emotional assessment of the patients in the hospital and fostered the independence of the patient in making the decisions concerning the preferred treatment method.

 Accordingly, I participated in the development and implementation of patient care plans through a collection of laboratory samples and the performance of simple laboratory tests. Another aspect of patient care that aroused my interest in joining the nursing school is the care of babies and the need to educate the mothers and families on hygienic and healthy baby care habits. In this regard, I participated in disseminating information on hygienic baby care procedures and monitoring of any illness signs on the young babies (Harrison 104).


I believe that I will contribute immensely to the nursing profession after the completion of my education. I am confident that I will gain practical skills that are capable of meeting the needs of the health care system. I will be in a position to understand the economic, political and social forces that have shaped the nursing profession. Accordingly, the demand for nursing care services is currently increasing thus I will be able to contribute towards delivering patient-centered care. I am sure the nursing knowledge, skills, and attitudes will enable me to improve the patient outcomes and ultimately lead to a higher satisfaction level among the patients.

 I will provide physical patient care, make sure all patients complete the treatment prescribed by the physicians and document the patient’s response to the particular treatment. I will provide patients the prescribed medication according to the existing legislation and assist in the rehabilitation of patients. In addition, I will assist in post-operative care procedures such as nutritional management and dressing of the wounds (Chang 14).
Accordingly, I will be capable of providing direct patient care such as administering prescribed medication, carrying out basic diagnoses, and providing emotional support to patients.

 The course will enable me to adequately demonstrate knowledge of nursing techniques and principles through constantly monitoring the patients’ medical conditions and updating the medical records.
I will be in a position to supervise junior nurses such as LPNs and midwifery students in order to foster the quality of health care. In this regard, I will adhere to ethical and professional expectations of the nursing profession through respecting patient autonomy, maintain cordial working relationships with my colleagues and providing the highest attainable quality of nursing care.

  I will remain committed to continuing nursing education through attending nursing workshops and participating in nursing associations in order to contribute to new nursing knowledge generation (Harrison 110).",Nursing,Admission/Application Essay,High School
https://studentshare.org/miscellaneous/1518896-research-methods,Research Methods,"Research Methods: Definitions YOUR FULL THE OF YOUR SCHOOL OR Confounding Variables A confounding variable isan element within a research study that varies ""systematically with the different treatment conditions"" (Hersen & Thomas, 2003, p. 432).  It has the ability to negatively impact the internal validity of a study by influencing the appearance of relationships within the variables.  It can do this by masking, i.e., making it appear as though no relationship is present when one actually is, or it can imply there is a relationship when there is not.

  Therefore, a confounder will be related to both the independent and the outcome variable. A fairly classic, everyday example of this is a fictional study that found a correlation between ice cream consumption and murder rates.  In studying the two variables in a specific area, e.g., New York City, it would become clear that there is a relationship between ice cream consumption and murder because over the course of the year, they both rise and fall in a seemingly related pattern.  Does homicidal proclivity derive from consuming too much ice cream  No, it doesn't.

  The confounding variable here is the heat.  As summer becomes hotter, people eat more ice cream; research has shown they also tend to have more violent outbursts.  In this case, there is no valid relationship between the two variables even though, from a limited perspective, there appears to be one.  Reliability and Validity	For a research study to be effective or believable, it has to have strong conclusions (validity) which are based on consistent measurements (reliability); thus, the research design needs to consider these two elements and factor in methods which ensure a high quantity of each (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2000, p. 129).  This approach provides the reader or researcher with confidence that the data was measured in a scientific and repeatable way, and that the conclusions are accurate and truthful as we can best understand them.

  A classic area for the explanation of these principles can be seen in any research study that employs the use of questionnaires with a sample population of individuals; the sample size can make the difference between a valid, reliable study and one that cannot be depended upon at all.  In most studies with small sample sizes, the authors will list that fact as a limitation or use it to call for additional research.  Similarly, those studies which have a large sample size consider that fact as an ""asset"" due to the strength or validity it lends to the conclusions (Kane, 2005, p. 59).  Regardless of the question, a study group of two individuals will not yield reliable results.

  Conversely, a study population of hundreds of thousands of individuals will.  In sum, if the measurements are logical, accurate, and repeatable, there is a high reliability which promotes the ability to draw truthful conclusions giving the study validity.

https://studentshare.org/miscellaneous/1512233-plagiarism-in-education,Plagiarism in Education,"PLAGIARISM As a person goes through different stages of life he/she learns the importance of education and realizes what an important role it has played in shaping up their careers. The basics start at school and slowly as they become mature they realize learning is a long process and helps them to be disciplined.The importance of learning is to share with others and make them educated. Studying at colleges and universities is totally a different ball game compared to schools. In colleges and universities the curriculum will be based on practical assumptions.

Courses offering at universities and colleges are termed as professional courses and inclined towards engineering, management and political careers. The students will be trained accordingly to fulfill the immediate requirements. But due to immense pressure from different quarters students and seasoned professionals tend to plagiarize. Though most of the people want their original work to be published, but due to strict deadlines they fear of missing the deadline. Here they commit the mistake of copying others materials that what we call plagiarism.

  The most important thing is to realize the responsibilities towards the society and taking up those responsibilities, which is an indication of a good citizen. Non-plagiaristic work is an indication that makes every citizen to know their responsibilities and utilize them properly.The best way to overcome plagiarism is teach students about its effects at very early age. Make students believe that they can be creative and willing to work hard. The best way to make a student understand is the use of pictorial description.

 Students can easily learn by watching a movie or pictorial description on the subject. Written tests should be conducted regularly so that students can assess their performance. If they get a lower grade teachers should help them through counselling or any other possible way. Teaching staffs employ methods like pairing students and make them to work as a group. The greatest responsibility of molding a child depends on parents, teachers, etc. Students are the building blocks of the society. Teachers should be well versed in their subject, learnt and should have enchanting character which should influence the child to imitate their teachers.

 One of the reasons for children and adolescents is suspected weakness in themselves or in others. Generally adolescents look to their peers for help all times. If their peers are noble enough then such behavior made declaim in adolescents.One of the main reasons of learning disabilities is the lack of concentration. Student's thoughts divert very easily. They could not keep up their concentration level up to the mark. Short-term memory is also one of the reasons. Some of them were unable to remember previous days lessons or unable to grasp features of learned lessons quickly.

           Another method that could be used is pair checking. In this method one student checks another student's work. This improves their capability of grasping the subject. Lectures by visiting professors help in great deal. Seminars should be conducted regularly. Students should be given an opportunity in giving seminars. Presentations play a vital role in seminars. This helps in assessing student's presentation and communication skills.  ReferenceWoolfolk, A. (2007). Educational Psychology.

https://studentshare.org/miscellaneous/1517818-the-north-american-free-trade-agreement,The North American Free Trade Agreement,"Terminal Objective #8 The North American Free Trade Agreement, which was ratified on January 1994, aims to remove the trade and investment barriers among the United States, Canada and Mexico.  The impact of NAFTA to US in particular is remarkable 	specifically in the agricultural sector as the agreement intends to eliminate all agricultural tariffs and quotas by 2008 (Foreign Agricultural Service, 2005).  This paper focuses on the benefits derived from and downside of the NAFTA for economic participants in the US.

	The positive effect of NAFTA can be illustrated citing the bilateral agricultural trade between the US and Mexico for select products.  For instance, the US is able to substitute the production of corn and nut at the exchange ratio of .  This means that at optimal labor utilization it can either produce, say 600 pounds of corn or 300 pounds of nuts.  Meanwhile, Mexico is able to substitute the production of same products at the exchange ratio of .  As such, it may choose to produce either 200 pounds of corn or 150 pounds of nuts.

 (Samuelson & Nordhaus, 2000)		Upon opening up or liberalizing trade between the two nations, their initial production possibility curves, represented by the solid line, pivot.  In case of the US, it could still produce 600 pounds of corn.  However, with trading with Mexico, it may now end up with relatively more nuts using Mexico's price ratio.  Similarly, Mexico ends up with the same quantity of nuts but this time it may end up with more corn as it traded with Mexico at the latter's price ratio.

  	The above example exhibits the benefits derived by countries, particularly exporters and consumers, when countries open up to trade or undergo trade liberalization.  According to the Foreign Agricultural Service (2005), sales of corn to Mexico and Canada increased by 175% with exponential increase in export value between 1993 and 2004.  In this case, farmers are able to find overseas markets for their harvest, thus, enhancing their earnings potential.  Similarly, consumers also gain as more producers, both foreign and local, enter the domestic market.

 This is because increased competition especially for agricultural products bids down prices.  They also get to enjoy higher quality products as businesses are driven to compete through quality aside from pricing in order to profit.	However, this may not bode well with local producers as their profits are squeezed with the presence of foreign competition in the domestic industry.  As such, local producers, particularly those with limited capitalization and exclusively cater to local consumers, may opt to shut down business with unprofitable operations given shrinking market share.

  With this, losers may also include those people who lose their jobs when these businesses seized to operate. (Mankiw, 1999)	Works CitedForeign Agricultural Service, 2005.  ""Benefits of NAFTA.""

How will this program fit into your long-term academic and professional goals	I have always believed in the important role of financial intermediaries in developing the economic performance of a nation by channeling excess fund from depositors to households and business organization. Professionally speaking, my long term goal is to stimulate and enhance the economic situation of Haiti through the efficient management of a financial institution which will provide the much needed financing that players in different domestic industries require.

 I have devoted the past fourteen years in accomplishing this task, foregoing other opportunities in the fields and engineering to establish Compagnie Financire d'Investissement S.A. (CFI SA), a micro-finance institution which primarily function to collect excess fund from the community, giving it back in the form of credit and micro-enterprise which serves as working capital and investment fund to pump up business activity and create more jobs for the citizens. 	My quest in accomplishing this goal will be hugely aided by a deeper knowledge and understanding of the financial system together with the role of financial intermediaries like banks, saving and loan cooperatives, and microfinance institutions.

 With my hands-on experience in managing CFI SA, I have learned that zeal and motivation are important yet insufficient in tackling and facing the numerous challenges posted by the changing business and economic climate. A Masters Degree in Banking and Finance will enhance my strengths and competencies by equipping me with the necessary knowledge and skills by broadening my understanding on various concepts such as global markets, corporate operations, securities markets, investments, methods of financial analysis, mergers and acquisitions.

 In the end, it will enable me to achieve my long term academic goal of acquiring the required skills in pursuing my professional objective specifically in the field of financial decision making in uncertain business environments which covers topics like corporate finance, risk management, and private banking. Given that this opportunity makes use of the case study method of instruction, what unique role do you think you can play in the classroom	I strongly believe in the case study method of instruction as it enables students to apply classroom concepts on real world situation of business organizations.

 In this medium, I hope to be both active contributor and receptive learner. I will be sharing my knowledge in managing the management of a financial institution derived from my practical experience in CFI SA especially on the problems faced by a microfinance organization in expansion such as the incapacity of obtaining financing from banks, limited capital, market access, administration, legality and collateral. Recognizing that Haiti is largely underdeveloped relative to other nations, I will be giving insight on how microfinance institutions operate in this type of economy where data are often unavailable.

 Have you ever previously studied and employed abroad	After obtaining a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 1992, I moved to Haiti to pursue my personal growth and development and build my career.

https://studentshare.org/law/1531880-is-state-government-an-effective-form-of-government,Is state government an effective form of government,"Government Is government an effective form of government There isn't any doubt regarding the existence of big differences among the s of the United States of America.  Professor Maggiore (n. d.) pointed out that ""the differences between the states are every bit as acute as the differences between nations.""  At the same time Maggiore (n. d.) suggested that ""state governments have profound affects on the lives of state residents.""  These characteristics have to be taken into account at the time of assessing the state governments as entities that indeed need to have their own written Constitutions so that their laws are established in a formal way and are known appropriately by all the citizens.

  This is a step forward in the process of decentralization out of federal power and of achieving efficiency by the state governments.    	Dr. Weiher stated that there are four general purposes of a written Constitution:  ""(1) Create a Form of Government; (2) Limit Governmental Power; (3) Define Who is a Citizen; and (4) Identify society's central values"" (Weiher, 2002).  This last point has to be emphasized.  The values of any given society change frequently from territory to territory.  People from different states have very different sets of values and a written Constitution is a reflection of the diversity of values among citizens of different states.

  For example, people from Utah have in common their unique religious beliefs.  The same can be said of other people from other states.  The federal government provides the unity within the diversity, and each state is a symbolic pluralistic unit in the spectrum of all the states bound together under the U.S. Constitution.  	The Wikipedia points out that ""the most obvious advantage of a codified constitution is the coherent and easily understood body of rules. A codified constitution at the least is simple to read, being a single document.

 The US constitution, for example, is only about 7,000 words long, and can be bought in most bookshops in the United States, whereas an uncodified constitution such as that of the UK is often ambiguous and difficult to interpret."" (Wikipedia, 2006).  This is a big advantage that has to be taken into consideration when evaluating the importance of a state Constitution in written form.  State laws are spread easily through a written document, but it is very important that state Constitutions shouldn't have any contradictory laws with the U.S. Constitution.

  	State government is really effective when it is founded on solid constitutional grounds.  We have to consider that ""every state, however, is to some extent unique, a product of its own blend of history, culture, and economic circumstances.  Even though every state has a governor, a state legislature, and a court system, in no two states will these operate with exactly the same powers, structures, and inter-relationships.""  (Digby & Grant, 2003).  The only way that a state government could be really effective is by adhering to the rule of law at all times.

  In other words, to obey and follow its Constitution in order to establish the appropriate legal, economic, political, religious and cultural environment in which all the citizens would find protected by the rule of law.  	Obeying and following the laws by all the citizens in any given state is a safeguard against anarchy and chaos.  All the government officials should adhere themselves to the rule of law in the first place as a commitment of working together for the benefit of the community.

  In such a way any state government can be very effective.  Unity within the diversity makes strong the Federal government that needs the state government as its representative in each and every state.  So we can positively say that state government is indeed an effective form of government when it follows the guidelines set in this essay in relation to having a written Constitution and abiding on the rule of law.Works CitedDigby, Michael F. & Grant, Chris.

https://studentshare.org/business/1523634-data-warehouse-presentation-evaluation,Data warehouse presentation evaluation,"Generally a data warehouse is a trace of an enterprise's past transactional and operational information that is stored in a specially designed database with appropriate facilities for data analysis and reporting. There is one common idea in the basis of data warehousing design: first data should be integrated from distributed and differently structured databases and then it should be picked out for purposes of reporting, decision support, analysis or control. There are four design approaches to this process that differ by scale of data, action sequences and complexity.

Top-Down Approach assumes that data is transferred from diverse OLTP systems into a centralized place where it could be used for analysis. As Eckerson writes, the major benefit of a Top-Down Approach is that it provides an integrated, flexible architecture to support downstream analytic data structures. On the downside, a top-down approach may take longer and cost more to deploy than other approaches, especially in the initial increments. (para.8-11)Bottom-Up Approach uses the bus structure that contains all the common elements that are used by data marts such as conformed dimensions, measures etc defined for the enterprise as a whole.

 The major benefit of a Bottom-Up Approach is user-friendly, flexible data structure using dimensional, star schema models. It also delivers value rapidly. One problem is that it requires organizations to enforce the use of standard dimensions and facts to ensure integration and deliver a single version of the truth. (Eckerson para.12-18)Hybrid Approach aims to harness the speed and user orientation of the Bottom-Up Approach to the integration of the Top-Down Approach. By Eckerson (para.19-25), Hybrid Approach recommends spending about two weeks developing an enterprise model in third normal form before developing the first data mart.

 The first several data marts are also designed in third normal form but deployed using star schema physical models.Federated Approach is a hub-and-spoke architecture often described as the ""architecture of architectures"" (""Tutorial 4"" para.12). The major problem with the federated approach is that it is not well documented. Also, integrating metadata is a pernicious problem in a heterogeneous, ever-changing environment.Various IT companies offer different solutions to implement data warehousing decisions.

NCR Teradata Solutions Methodology allows a controlled way of building and introducing a successful data warehouse. It describes 4 steps required to generate the information out of the structured data. (NCR Corporation)The SAS System provides a data warehouse model that addresses the entire scope of warehouse Management, Organization and Exploitation. (Welbrock 2-12)The goal of the Microsoft Data Warehousing Framework is to provide access to any data from any source. Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 includes built-in support for OLE-DB and Open Information Models for universal data and metadata access.

 I think now it is the most developed methodology, because it has great facilities for data transformation from third parties through Data Transformation Services. (Microsoft Corporation)Kimball Methodology includes the Nine-Step Method in the Design of a Data Warehouse, following to which one can get a rationally built data warehouse, but it requires a lot of experience to successfully use it.

Breathtakingly simple, yet deep in its message, it firmly guides the individual to seek God within. What is remarkable in his poetry is the fact that he has used simple the everyday language of the people, so all can experience the wonder and the beauty of his work.

 Tulsidas was what is known as a Bhakti Kavi, or devotee poet, driven and inspired by his utmost devotion to the Lord. During his lifetime, he aspired to bring India's epics and poetry, hitherto inaccessible to anyone but the Brahmins, or higher caste people, who were the only ones who knew Sanskrit, the language of the priests, to the common man.Tulsidas was born Rama Bhola in the mid-sixteenth century, during the reign of Humayun, in a place called Rajpur in India. It is assumed that he was born under an unlucky star, because he was abandoned immediately after birth.

  Adopted by a wandering sadhu, or ascetic, he roamed the width and breadth of India, visiting many holy places - a story in part supported by passages in his poems. The sadhu renamed him Tulsidas, servant of the sacred tulsi plant, which was used in a ceremony of purification of the infant. It was from his guru, Narahari Das that he first learnt the story of Ramayana, but since it was in Sanskrit, the language of the Brahmin classes, he only grasped the story after many recitations. The beauty of the sacred epic made him determined to write it in the vernacular for his own benefit and for that of others in his position.

Tulsidas married early, a girl named Ratnavali, by whom he had a son named Taraka, who died at an early age. So lost was he in the devotion of his wife, that for a brief while he deserted his God, Rama. He was recalled firmly back to his path by his wife who reproached him for showing more affection to her than to his Lord. Struck with remorse, Tulsi left her and took to an ascetic life.With his base as Ayodhya, he visited distant places of pilgrimage. It was in Ayodhya that the Lord Rama is said to have appeared to him in a dream, and to have commanded him to write a Ramayana in the language used by the common people.

 He began this work in the year 1574 and within 3 years had written his greatest epic poem, popularly called Tulsi-krita Ramayana, but entitled by its author Ramacharitamanasa, or the Lake of Rama's Deeds. It is said that the Lord, impressed by his devotion, ""poured Himself,"" into Tulsidas when he wrote the 'Ramayana.'Sri Aurobindo, a prolific writer and poet, called the Tulsidas' Ramayana ""a long chant of religious devotion"". Comparing it to Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, he observed that few works of literature produced anywhere in the world had so influenced the life and culture of a people. (qtd. Goel, ) The Indian epics have a great deal of ethical and moral content, and Tulsidas, by bringing the Ramayana to the masses has been an agent in fashioning what is best and sweetest in the Hindu national character.

 Apart from the 'Tulsi Ramayana', Tulsidas has also written several hundred bhajans (devotional songs) and couplets. Poetry has outlasted his mortal frame and earned him eternal immortality. The poetry sheds light on ordinary, day-to-day situations, creating awareness of the Creator Himself, gently directing people on how to reach Him within each individual self.

https://studentshare.org/history/1519402-defeat-at-shiloh,Defeat at Shiloh,"Defeat at Shiloh The Battle of Shiloh, in the opinion of several historians, counts as one of the more important of the Confederate-Union military engagements of the Civil War, and was definitely one of the bloodiest, with losses on either side exceeding the ten thousand mark (Suhr).  Fought south of Savannah by the west bank of the Tennessee River, between April 6-7th, 1862, the Battle of Shiloh initially appeared as of it were going to culminate in a victory for the Confederates but, ultimately became a decisive victory for the Union army insofar as it was the starting point of their victorious campaigns in the West (Wertz).

  In discussing the mentioned battle, this essay shall focus on Purdy's engagement, the arrival of the Confederates and the movement from Corinth.Preparations for what was later to be known as the Battle of Shiloh began in February 1862.  In the wake of the Confederate loss of both Fort Henry and Forte Donelson, the Confederate General Alber Sydney Johnston withdrew to Tennessee for reorganization purposes.  Recognizing that the Confederates were planning for action, Major General Ulysses Grant moved his army to West Tennessee, occupying Pittsburg Landing by March 1862.

 Directly following, orders were issued to Major General Don Carlos Buell to join Grant and, with their joint armies, undertake a seizure of the Memphis and Charleston Railways (Veit).  The plan, as explained by Suhr was to cut off Confederate supplies and, to all intents and purposes, encircle and suffocate the Confederate forces.Even as the Union army was proactively planning to offset what they had determined to be Confederate preparations for offensive, and take the offensive themselves, the Confederate General, Johnston, was preparing for an offensive on Grant's forces, scheduled for April 4th, 1862 (Bagby).

  The Confederate forces which had been scattered in the wake of the Forts Henry and Donelson losses was gathered, reorganized and fortified by fresh forces, finally making an army of 55,000 men, renamed the Army of the Mississippi.  This army, in its entirety was concentrated at and around Corinth, approximately 20 miles from Grant's position.  On 3rd April, Johnston departed with 44,000 men planning to launch a surprise attack on Grant's forces on 4th April and in advance of Buell's arrival (Bagby).

  The plan, as explained by Bagby, was to attack Grant's forces from the left, strike a divide within the Union flanks separate them from their gunboat supports on the Tennessee, thereby closing off their retreat path following which the Union army would be driven to swamps in the West and completely decimated (Bagby).As noted above, the offensive was scheduled for April 4th but multitudinous factors led to a 48 hour delay.  As the Confederate Army Brigadier General Marcus Joseph Wright recorded in his diaries, on April 4th the ""enemy's cavalry dashed in on our picket beyond Purdy,"" with the unexpected engagement ultimately forcing the Confederate forces to leave Purdy on April 5th and march 23 miles to Shiloh (90-91).

  In other words, and despite the fact that Grant's army, according to the General's own admission that he had not suspected the Confederate's plan of attack for April 4th, the Confederate army at Purdy unexpectedly found itself on the defensive despite their preparations for offensive (Bagby).  This fact, needless to say, and insofar as it entailed an unexpected engagement and forced a Confederate withdrawal from Purdy, delayed the execution of the above explained battle plan by 48 hours, in addition to which the stated development necessitated a change in the mentioned plans since the Confederate army no longer had a stronghold at Purdy.

  It was at this point that Johnson's second in command, General Beauregard, advised a withdrawal to Corinth, arguing that insofar as the element of surprise had been lost, the Confederate army needed to rethink the entire offensive and reorganize accordingly.  Johnston, however, refused the advice and insisted that the Confederate army move ahead to Pittsburg Landing where Grant's Union forces were (Bagby).The Battle of Shiloh was finally fought on April 6th, concluding with a Union victory on April 7th.

   The Confederate army initially launched a ferocious attack but, as stated by Bagby, Johnson unexpectedly and inexplicably decided to lead the charge straight into the Union forces as a result of which, he was killed.  Without their General there to modify the battle plans and reassess the situation, the Confederate army fell back.  To further complicate the situation, Buell arrived with his forces on that very day.  The Confederate army began a hasty retreat along the way to Corinth with the Union army in ferocious pursuit (Veit).

  The battle was, thus, lost.BibliographyBagby, Milton.  ""A Meeting At Shiloh.""  America's Civil War.  14, 2.  May, 2001.  Academic Search Premier.  Online Database.

Research in endocrine sphere was developing fast during last two decades, and the modern techniques of molecular biology are successfully implemented to cure various diseases of endocrine nature.

 Investigations and findings made in the field of molecular biology allowed defining specific genes that are related to endocrine system. Examining mutations of these genes helped define the nature of endocrine diseases and work out successful treatment therapies. Molecular theories helped understand the mechanisms of gene expression. (Greenspan)Researches in the sphere connected to gene approach allow new therapy used in treating endocrine diseases. This therapy is based on the possibility of intervention on a molecular level, producing a curative effect.

 This therapy can be implemented in the cases of monogenic illnesses, for instance, hypothalamic diabetes, or deficiency of GH, or for multifactorial illnesses, such as cancer, adiposity or diabetes mellitus. The perspective of development of molecular biology promises a lot of new inventions in the field of treating tumours of endocrine nature. (Greenspan)The notion of immune, endocrine and neurogenic systems as of an integrated system with interrelations within this system helps understand that many chemical mediators function not as hormones, like it was considered before, but circulate in specific way.

 That's why this sphere of endocrinology that is connected to circulations of mediators and hormones, and investigating the mechanisms of cellular processes control will be regarded as the branch of microbiology at the nearest future. (Greenspan)Changes Which Occur Within The Cardiovascular System Around The Birth Of An IndividualThe circulatory system of human and a fetus is different. Fetus doesn't breath with the help of its lungs, getting oxygen and nutrition from his mother's body with the help of placenta and umbilical cord.

 Just after the birth fetus' circulation system changes. This process includes closure of foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus. (Cardiovascular Changes At Birth)Two major events that determine changes that occur to the fetal circulation are beginning of respiration process and finishing placental circulation of the blood. Regarding the whole cardiovascular system in general it is necessary to speak about the changes that happen in umbilical veins, umbilical arteries, ductus arteriosus (which serves for protecting the fetus' lungs from overload, controls the strengthening of an appropriate ventricle, balances processes in lungs, helps carrying blood with med saturation of oxygen), ductus venosus (which connects the umbilical vein and the IVC, regulates a flow of blood, carries blood highly saturated with oxygen), foramen ovale (that carries blood with oxygen from right lung to left lung).

 (Cardiovascular Changes At Birth)Lung aeration after the birth is characterized with reduced resistance of vascular system in lungs due to expansion of the lungs, increase in flow of the blood which raises atrial pressure, and thinning of the walls of arteries in lungs, due to extension of the lungs and increasing size of lungs. (Cardiovascular Changes At Birth)After the first breath of a child the alveoli of the lungs open, pressure in tissues of the lungs decreases, blood flow from the right heart goes to the capillaries in alveoli, pressure in heart's right side goes weaker, while pressure in the heart's left part increases, because larger amount of blood goes to the left lung through the pulmonary veins.

 At last stage of changing in circulatory system blood pressure in a human body grows higher in aorta and the system of circulation is established and functions well.

https://studentshare.org/literature/1520811-hamlet-essay,What Happens in Hamlet: Macmillan,"HAMLET Literature in its shortest definition is the reflection of life. As life is never a complete joy or a complete sadness It is the mix of thesetwo, in the same way a good piece of literature carries these emotions in such a way that they cannot be separated. Therefore when the audience comes across such situation, they go through simultaneous experience of pleasure and disquietude at the same.	The revenge tragedy Hamlet by William Shakespeare is also one of such plays. There are certain elements, issues, developments, and outcomes that both evoke pleasure and disquietude.

 First of all it is the Hamlet's relation with Ophelia that is quite pleasurable and pathetic at the same time. It is pleasurable when the beautiful Ophelia appears in act II scene I as, ""The fair Ophelia - Nymph in thy orisons"" The entire play is full of such lines showing her beauty and innocence. However, Hamlet's later attitude towards her mixed with the death of her father and her own tragic end creates dissatisfaction among the audience.	Secondly Hamlet's tragic end creates unrest in the minds of the audience, because the character of Hamlet has universal appeal and significance.

 His figure, as Brandes puts it, ""is one of the very few immortal figures of art and poetry. Like Cervantes' Don Quixote, and Goethe's Faust.""  Such a figure did not deserve such a fate. His witty remarks and his discussions with Ophelia and Polonius create pleasure in the play.  No doubt some critics are never reluctant to blame Hamlet's irresoluteness as the cause of his tragic death, but they ignore the fact, that Hamlet was not a layman to act impulsively. He was a thinker and fine soldier.

 Ophelia, in a soliloquy deplores the fact that Hamlet, a combination of the courtier, the scholar, and the soldier how could he loss his reason.O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword(Act III Scene I Lines 151-152) 	Thirdly the death of the queen is also a blend of pleasure and disquietude. She played a role in the murder of his husband, therefore she deserved a penalty, but she received at a time, when she realized her crime and became repentant 	Fourthly, the overall impact and action of the play is perfect blending of pleasure and disquietude.

 We take a sigh of relief at the death of the king, because he is a merciless murderer and deserves death. We also feel relief, up to some extent, at the death of the queen because we feel ""justice has been done"", but at the same time the premature death of Ophelia, the death of Leartes and the death of Hamlet create unrest. Especially in the case of Ophelia and Leartes the audience has no idea, why should these two innocent characters  suffer such a tragic death.	The basic reason for such an effect of pleasure and disquietude in many plays of William Shakespeare, particularly in Hamlet, Macbeth, and King Lear is because of the fact that his bad characters are never completely devil incarnates and his good characters are also never innocent like angles.

 All of these characters are life like and appeal to the reason, and it is blending of evilness and goodness in them which creates this effect of pleasure and disquietude.ReferenceJ. Dover Wilson. What Happens in Hamlet: Macmillan. 1935.",Literature,Essay,College
